There is no firm evidence or randomized trials that compared classical immunosuppressive compounds to biological agents; or identified the best treatment in this condition. The burden of Neutrophil Immune Unit has been reduced with the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, raising the question of which of these compounds should be preferentially used in recently active Neutrophil Immune Unit with steroid dependency. Main objective and primary endpoint: Primary Objective The objective is to compare the efficacy of adalimumab (80mg Anti Thrombin day 0, then 40mg/14 days from Week 1 to Week 35 subcutaneously) with that of standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil [2g/day orally] for 36 weeks) in recently active non-infectious intermediate, posterior uveitis, and pan-uveitis with steroid dependency. Primary endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the treatment failure rate Anti Thrombin 36 weeks. Treatment failure is defined by any of the following in Anti Thrombin least one eye: new active, inflammatory chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesions; worsening of best corrected visual acuity (Best corrected visual acuity) by>3 lines; - 2- step increase in anterior chamber cell grade and/or in vitreous haze relative to baseline Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary Objectives: Comparing adalimumab (80mg Anti Thrombin day 0, then 40mg/14 days from Week 1 to Week 35 subcutaneously) to standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil [(2g/day orally)] for 36 weeks): To evaluate the cumulative incidence of treatment failure up to Week 55 after inclusion To evaluate the change in best corrected visual acuity (Best corrected visual acuity, logMAR) from baseline to week Week 55 ; To evaluate the change in ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous from baseline to week Week 55; To evaluate the change in other signs including vessel leakage, from baseline to week Week 55; To evaluate the presence of macular edema from baseline to week Week 55; To evaluate the quality of life related to uveitis, from inclusion to Week 55; To evaluate steroid sparing effect from baseline to Week 55; To evaluate the number and time to relapse of uveitis; and the characteristics of uveitis Anti Thrombin worsening from baseline to Week 55; To evaluate the effect on underlying systemic disease when appropriate from baseline to Week 55; To evaluate the safety of adalimumab and mycophenolate mofetil (up to Week 55; Secondary Endpoints, Time to treatment failure up to Week 55; logMAR Best corrected visual acuity in each eye, Anti Thrombin Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 30, Week 36 and Week 55; Anterior chamber cell grade in each Anti Thrombin Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 30, Week 36 and Week 55; Vitreous haze grade (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria) in each eye Anti Thrombin Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 30, Week 36 and Week 55; Central retinal thickness in each eye from baseline Anti Thrombin Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 30, Week 36 and Week 55; Proportion of patients with central macular thickness< 300 microns Anti Thrombin Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 30, Week 36 and Week 55; Time to optical coherence tomographic (Optical coherence tomography) evidence of macular edema in Anti Thrombin least one eye, up to Week 55; National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionaire-25 (VFQ-25) composite score, Anti Thrombin Week 12, Week 24, and Week 36; Measures of corticosteroid sparing (e.g., percent meeting targets [<0.1 Milligrams/Kilograms/day prednisone], mean change, mean dose Anti Thrombin week 55, and cumulative dose); Cumulative incidence of relapse and number of relapses up to Week 55; Other clinical manifestations of underlying disease (depending on the underlying disease) will be evaluated up to Week 55 Safety and tolerability of treatments as assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events and treatment discontinuation from baseline to Week 55 Design of the study: This is a prospective phase III clinical trial, multicenter, open-label, two-arm randomized (1:1) clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adalimumab and standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) in subjects with recently active intermediate posterior uveitis or pan-uveitis despite steroid use [i.e oral prednisone > 7 Milligrams/day (or equivalent)].

Participation in another interventional study involving human participants or in the exclusion period Anti Thrombin the end of a previous study involving human participants, if applicable Investigational medicinal product(s): Eligible patients with recently active Neutrophil Immune Unit will be randomized Anti Thrombin 1:1 ratio between: Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg Anti Thrombin day 0, then 40mg/14 days from Week 1 to Week 35 subcutaneously) Arm 2: standard of care defined by Mycophenolate mofetil 2 Grams per day orally for 36 weeks The 2 treatment groups will receive the same corticosteroid regimen. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients with Neutrophil Immune Unit will receive oral prednisone ≥ 10 Milligrams/day (or oral corticosteroid equivalent) with a maximum of 35 Milligrams/day of prednisone or . A common prednisone-tapering programme will be applied to both groups with a decrease until discontinuation between week 13 and week 19, as long as the disease is inactive. Comparator treatment: Arm 2: Standard of care defined by Mycophenolate mofetil 2 Grams per day orally for 36 weeks Interventions added for the study: - Adalimumab (80mg Anti Thrombin day 0, then 40mg/14 days from Week 1 to Week 35 subcutaneously) - Visit Anti Thrombin week 4, 8, 16, 20 and 30 weeks - HCG plasmatic or urine pregnancy test Anti Thrombin inclusion, and urine pregnancy test Anti Thrombin 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36 and 55 weeks, and monthly until 6 weeks after stopping Mycophenolate mofetil therapy, and until 5 months after stopping Adalimumab therapy, unless menopause or sterility is confirmed. - Fundoscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography (Optical coherence tomography) Anti Thrombin 4, 8, 16, 20 and 30 weeks - Retinal angiography Anti Thrombin 36 weeks - Quality of life questionnaires Anti Thrombin Day 0, Week 12, Week 24 and 36 weeks Expected benefits for the participants and for society: Refractory non-infectious uveitis is a serious ocular pathology, accounting for 10-15% of total blindness cases. Reliable clinical data are required for the treatment of uveitis and more particularly in the use of biotherapies. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have shown a sustained remission rate of 70% in severe refractory/relapsing uveitis. The incidence of blindness in UNI has been reduced in recent years with the use of biotherapies, raising the question of whether these therapies should be prescribed earlier in the management of patients with severe non-infectious uveitis. Compared to conventional immunosuppressants, biotherapies are fast acting and highly effective in corticosteroids sparing, thus limiting the risk of cataract and/or cortico-induced glaucoma. FOCUS is the first randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adalimumab to standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) in the maintenance treatment of corticosteroid-dependent UNI. This study will validate and optimize the treatment of hard-to-treat patients with uveitis. intrathecal injection may also confirm whether or not adalimumab is superior to mycophenolate mofetil in terms of efficacy. intrathecal injection will allow a direct comparison of the safety profiles of these treatments. intrathecal injection could significantly improve the management of patients with corticosteroid-dependent UNI and finally help in the selection of the best treatment to prevent the onset of blindness and side effects in these difficult to treat cases. The expected benefit is both individual, by reducing morbidity for patients with non-infectious uveitis, and collective, by reducing the costs of unemployment, disability and hospitalization caused by UNI. Risks and burdens added by the study: Risks associated with the toxicities of the investigational drugs Risks associated with use of concomitant medication The risk level of the study : Risk C Practical implementation: After the collection of their free and informed consent, eligible patients will be randomized into one of 2 groups Anti Thrombin the randomization visit (Day 0) Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg Anti Thrombin day 0, then 40mg/14 days from Week 1 to Week 35 subcutaneously) Arm 2: Mycophenolate mofetil 2 Grams per day orally for 36 weeks Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive the same corticosteroid regimen Anti Thrombin inclusion. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive corticosteroids (10-35 Milligrams/day) Anti Thrombin inclusion. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups with a decrease until discontinuation between week 13 and week 19 as long as the disease is inactive: Number of participants included: 120 patients (60 in each arms) Number of centres: Multicenter national study including 27 centers (26 recruitment centres) Duration of the study: Duration of inclusions: 30 months Duration of participation of each patient: 13 months and 3 weeks (55 weeks) Total duration of the study: 44 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.15 patient/month/center Statistical analysis: This is a prospective, two-arm randomized, open-label, phase III trial comparing Adalimumab to Standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) based on a binary primary endpoint (treatment failure Anti Thrombin week 36 of treatment). Randomization will be stratified on macular oedema, and steroid dose Anti Thrombin inclusion. This trial will be conducted using a group sequential design with one interim analysis after 50% of primary observations have been completed, with efficacy and futility early stopping rules. Specifically, assuming a probability of treatment failure (primary endpoint) of 50% in the SoC control population versus 20% under the alternative hypothesis with adalimumab, a total number of 106 patients (53 per randomization arm) is required to ensure 90% power with a 2.5% one-sided type I error risk, accounting for one interim analysis after 50% of primary observations have been completed and using Lan & DeMets O’Brien & Fleming-type risk-spending functions to define efficacy and futility (non-binding) early stopping rules. Moreover, we plan to include a total of 120 patients (60 per randomization arm) to account for potential 10% of lost-to-follow-up.",

    "page_content": "Full title: «Exploring venlafaxine pharmacokinetic variability by a phenotyping approach » Scientific justification: Regarding the direct costs and the social value of depression, the decision of an antidepressant treatment prescription must be optimized as much as possible. The development of a personalized medicine in psychiatry may reduce treatment failure, intolerance or resistance, and hence burden and costs of affective disorders. There is hope that biomarkers will be found to guide treatment selection. intrathecal injection might be of decisive interest to be able to assess an individual’s metabolism activity. We propose here to explore the relationship between the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DME) and transporters- assessed by a phenotypic approach and the efficacy of antidepressants. We will focus on venlafaxine (V) that provides a reasonable second-step choice for patients with depression and is used extensively in psychiatric practice, and the metabolism of which involves several cytochromes (CYP) P450 enzymes and the transporter P-general practitioner. Primary objective: To study the correlation between the concentration of V and its metabolite ODesmethylV (V+ODV) and drug metabolism variability assessed by a phenotypic approach. Secondary objectives: To compare between responders and non responders, as well as between patients with or without side effects: The CYP2C19 activity and the prevalence of each profile of metabolism The CYP2D6 activity and the prevalence of each profile of metabolism The CYP3A4 activity and the prevalence of of each profile of metabolism The P-general practitioner activity and the prevalance of each profile of transport To study the correlation between V+ODV concentration/dose and V+ODV concentration and antidepressant efficacy and tolerance To study the correlation between the ratio ODV/V and CYP2D6 activity To study the correlation between the concentration Anti Thrombin 2 hours and the Area Under the Curve (2,3,6 hours) of the metabolic ratio hydroxyomeprazole/omeprazole To conduct exploratory association analyses between blood biomarkers (candidate mRNA and miRNA) and the tolerance and efficacy of V To analyse the role of genetic variations of DNA in the determination of CYP2C19 and 2D6 phenotypes, in patients with Picomolar profile.

Informed consent signed to participate to the study Individuals covered by social security regimen Non-inclusion criteria: Patients treated by more than one antidepressant other than mirtazapine or mianserine Patients currently treated with one of the drug substrate of the cocktail and/or by esomeprazole Sensitivity or contra-indication to any of the substrate drugs used Current pregnancy, desire to get pregnant, or breastfeeding Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia Background Therapy: Oral extended release Venlafaxine, regardless of the dose Anti Thrombin selection, which will be increased up to 375mg during the study according to the psychiatric follow-up if necessary. Challenge agents: For the assessment of drug-metabolizing enzyme activity, the patients will be given the cocktail probe drugs, by oral route, one time during the study: A capsule of omeprazole 10mg 6.8 ml of an oral liquid formulation of Dextrométhorphane bromhydrate (Tussidane 1.5mg/ml , syrup) 1 Milligrams of an injectable solution of Midazolam for oral administration (Midazolam 1mg/mL, injectable solution) A tablet of fexofenadine 120mg Other procedures added by the research: The dosage of venlafaxine (V) and ODemethylV (ODV) The collect of DNA, circulating, mRNA and miRNA transcripts The assessment of drug efficacy, tolerance and adherence using standardized questionnaires Risks added by the research: The administration of a cocktail drugs with current authorization once during the study Two blood samples of 5mL, one blood sample of 2.5ml, one blood sample of 7mL and three blood spots. Risque B Practical procedure: The selection visit takes place during the usual medical follow-up and will include the measurement of a MADRS and HAMD score. The other visits will be carried out as part of a traditional hospitalization if intrathecal injection is needed regarding the patient's psychiatric condition. Conversely, they will be done during a day hospitalization (V0 and V1) or during a consultation (V2, V3). They will be systematically supervised by a practitionner. The inclusion (V0) takes place 0-20 days after the increase in V dosage and will include: Verification of inclusion and non inclusion criteria Signature of the consent Screen for tobacco use and Fagerstrom test Characteristics of the mood disorder Anxiety scale Tyrer QIDS-SR16 Criteria for rating medication trials for antidepressant failure and level of resistance MARS score PRISE-M score FISBER score The visit V1 will take place between 7-21 days after Visit V0 and will include: -Sampling for the dosage of venlafaxine (V) and ODemethylV (ODV) -The collect of DNA, circulating mRNA and miRNA transcripts -The phenotypic study The administration of the cocktail probe drugs: A capsule of omeprazole 10mg 6.8 ml of an oral liquid formulation of Dextrométhorphane bromhydrate (Tussidane 1.5mg/ml , syrup) 1 Milligrams of an injectable solution of Midazolam for oral administration (Midazolam 1mg/mL, injectable solution) A tablet of fexofenadine 120mg The pill and liquid formulations will be taken orally successively with a glass of water. Followed by the Capillary blood samples Anti Thrombin 2, 3 and 6 hours after the cocktail administration (1 drops each hour) from a small finger prick on the DBS device for the measurement of cocktail drug concentrations (drug parent and metabolites) The visits V2 and V3 will take place between 25-40 days (4 weeks) and 50-70 days (8 weeks) after Visit V0, with a psychologist or a doctor. They will included the assessment of drug efficacy, tolerance and adherence: MARS score PRISE-M score FISBER score MADRS HAMD QIDS-SR16 Number of subjects chosen: 205 Number of centers: 12 clinical centers in France 7 centers of clinical investigations in France 4 centers involved in biological analysis (3 in France and 1 in Switzerland) Research period: The included subjects’ length of participation: 7-70 days Inclusion period: 78 months Total maximal research period: 78 months+70 days=2442 days Number of inclusions expected per center and per month: 0.9/center/month Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis will be performed once the sample size has been reached, and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia the end point measures available. Our hypothesis is that the prevalence of patients with a CYP2C19 UM profile is twice as high in non-responders in comparison with responders, World health organization have a CYP2C19 metabolic profile comparable to that of Caucasians (20%). To demonstrate that the prevalence is two-fold that observed in non-responders, with a type I error Anti Thrombin 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, the sample size is tabulated below according to the prevalence of response. Thus, to anticipate for potential large disproportion in responders/non responders (that will be only defined after study inclusion) we decided to include 205 patients. This will allow to control for type I and type II error rates in the comparison of the prevalence of CYP2C19 UM profile among these groups. In addition the sample size will allow to study sufficient numbers of CYP2D6 Picomolar, intramuscular, and UM to determine the effects of CYP2D6 variations on V and ODV plasma levels and their efficacy or risk of adverse events. The type I error rate will be fixed Anti Thrombin 0.05. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia tests will be two-sided and compared thus to 0.05. Multiple imputations, which are a popular approach for handling the pervasive problem of missing data in biostatistics, will be used. intrathecal injection is usually performed under a missing Anti Thrombin random (MAR) assumption. Multiple imputations by chained equation are to our knowledge the most flexible approach to handle complex patterns of missing data (including categorical data, quantitative data, and survival data). Primary analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Secondary exploratory analyses will consider the population of compliers, that is, those World health organization completed the treatment according to the scheduled protocol.",

    "page_content": "Full title: Phase III study comparing Graft versus host disease prophylaxis with Anti ThymoGlobulin-thymoglobulin to Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin-grafalon in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplatic syndrome and receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a 10/10 Human Leukocyte Antigen matched unrelated donor following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen by fludarabine-treosulfan Scientific justification: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Most of the patients requiring an allo-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation are above 50 years of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. The optimal RIC and Graft versus host disease prophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the disease while preventing Graft versus host disease remains to be determined for elderly patients. A phase III trial comparing the conventional RIC fludarabine-busulfan 2 days to fludarabine-treosulfan demonstrated an advantage for the flu-treosulfan arm in terms of event free survival (event-free survival), that should therefore be considered as the new standard of RIC regimen for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and MDS. Graft versus host disease prevention has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes by potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and immune reconstitution. Anti-thymocyte globulins (Anti ThymoGlobulin) are recommended to reduce the risk of acute and chronic Graft versus host disease in transplants performed with matched unrelated donors. However, the optimal type of Anti ThymoGlobulin between the 2 approved brands (Anti ThymoGlobulin-thymoglobulin and Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin-grafalon) displaying distinct characteristics and the optimal dose of Anti ThymoGlobulin are still unknown. In a retrospective study of patients transplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and unrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we observed that Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin was associated with a reduction of grade II-intravenous infusion acute Graft versus host disease in comparison to Anti ThymoGlobulin without increasing the incidence of relapse. In this phase III randomized study, we propose to compare Graft versus host disease prevention with Anti ThymoGlobulin versus Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and MDS patients above 50 years of age transplanted with a matched unrelated donor following a fludarabine-treosulfan RIC, with the hypothesis that Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin would better control Graft versus host disease in this population of patients thus limiting the risk of morbidity and mortality of the procedure. Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: to compare the incidence of grade II-intravenous infusion acute Graft versus host disease Anti Thrombin day 100 post-transplantation in MDS or Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients transplanted with a 10/10 matched unrelated donor (MUD) following a reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine-treosulfan between patients receiving a Graft versus host disease prophylaxis with Anti ThymoGlobulin-thymoglobulin versus Anti-Thymocyte Lymphocyte Globulin-grafalon.

In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective trial testing the use of ruxolitinib before transplantation (“JAK-ALLO study” NCT01795677). Outcome of patients was better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling donor than an unrelated donor confirming other studies (Kröger others, 2009; Rondelli others, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO trial, acute Graft versus host disease incidence was high, often hyperacute and severe. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a registry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation (haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj others, 2018). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of cases. One-year overall survival (overall survival) and disease-free survival (disease-free survival) were 61 and 58% which favorably compared to outcome after unrelated transplantation. Genova team has also reported impressive results after haplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante others, 2015). Bregante others have reported outcome of 2 cohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the more frequent use of haplo in the second period (54% versus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second period with overall survival Anti Thrombin 70% versus 49% and authors suggest that this improvement is related to the best outcome among haplo transplantation. The improvement of outcome after haplo has been attributed to a better Graft versus host disease prophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after unrelated transplantation and especially in Human Leukocyte Antigen mismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in family haplo identical transplantation, this current study proposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in myelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor. Main objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is disease-free survival and without rejection one year after haplo-identical transplantation in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis. The main criteria of judgement is disease- and rejection-free survival 12 months after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation. Secondary objectives and endpoints: To assess -incidence of acute Graft versus host disease grade 2/4 Anti Thrombin 100 days -incidence of acute Graft versus host disease grade 3 or 4 Anti Thrombin 100 days -engraftment Anti Thrombin 100 days -incidence of chronic Graft versus host disease Anti Thrombin 12 months -non-relapse mortality Anti Thrombin 12 months -overall survival Anti Thrombin 12 months -relapse/progression incidence Anti Thrombin 12 months -rejection incidence Anti Thrombin 12 months -time to neutrophil engraftment Anti Thrombin 100 days -time to platelet engraftment Anti Thrombin 100 days -infection incidence Anti Thrombin 100 days and Anti Thrombin 12 months -cytokine profile during transplantation (day-7+/- 1 day , day 0 and day 7+/- 1 day ) -impact of genetic alterations on overall survival Anti Thrombin 12 months and non-relapse morality Anti Thrombin 12 months Design of the trial: This a phase 2 multicentric study Population of trial subjects: Patients with a myelofibrosis World health organization have no contraindication to transplant and World health organization have an advanced disease by international scores could be proposed to the trial if they do not have an Human Leukocyte Antigen-matched donor.

A sensitivity analysis will be performed in patients World health organization will actually receive the graft. Only patient consent withdrawals with positive report of not using their data, if any, will be excluded. Baseline summary statistics, namely percentages or median [interquartile range, IQR], will be performed. The right censored endpoint will be estimated using nonparametric methods. Kaplan Meier curves and cumulative incidence curves will be considered in case of non-informative or informative censoring based on the log-rank test or the Gray test, respectively. Adjustment on potential confounders will used the Cox proportional hazards models. Model assumptions will be checked using a test for proportional hazards and spline smoothing of residuals for the log-linearity assumption. Statistical analyses will be performed on SAS (SAS Inc, Cary, NC) and R (https://www.R-project.org/) software packages.",

    "page_content": "Full title: CAMOVID: A multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camostat mesylate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection – COVID-19 in ambulatory adult patients Scientific justification: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as COVID-19. On the 22nd March 2020, 2920142 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 12784 deaths were reported by The World Health Organization (1). On the 31 March 2020, there were 52827 severe cases in France, including 3532 deaths. The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical. If most infections are not severe, 15% of infected patients will require hospitalization and 5% will require intensive care unit admission (2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on clinical symptoms and microbiological testing. To test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, testing centers use a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction) on nasal swab in patients with productive cough. A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no controlled data supporting the use of any specific treatment (anti-viral drugs or immunomodulatory drugs), and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown (3). SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through the binding of its spike (S) protein to the membranous aminopeptidase called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Among other tissues, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 expression has mainly been found on pneumocytes, enterocytes, renal tubular cells and podocytes. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires S protein priming by cellular serine protease cellular serine protease, which entails S protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (4). In a murine model of SARS-CoV pneumonia, Iwata-Yoshikawa others. showed that cellular serine protease-KO mice had weakened inflammatory cytokine responses and reduced lung injury than control mice (5). Hoffmann others. found that a cellular serine protease inhibitor, the camostat mesylate, blocked viral entry and reduce infection of human primary pneumocytes and lung cell lines by SARS-CoV-2. They also showed that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry (4). Another study performed by Bojkova others (5) showed that camostat mesylate reduced cytopathogenic effect due to SARS-CoV-2 in human colonic cell lines. Camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that is commonly used in Japan (Anti Thrombin a dose of 600 Milligrams/day) and has been successfully and safely used to treat pancreatitis-associated pain (6) and post-operative reflux oesophagitis (7). Side effects that have been reported are rare Anti Thrombin these doses (nausea, diarrhea, hypersensitivity in 0.1 to 0.5% of the cases, cytopenias in less than 0.1% and hyperkaliemia and abnormal hepatic function in less than 0.05%). We hypothesize that camostat mesylate, initiated early in SARS-CoV2 infection, can reduce viral infection and viral cytopathogenic effect by blocking SARS-CoV2 entry into cells, and therefore prevent deterioration toward severe forms of COVID19. Main objective and primary endpoint: Objective: Evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesylate in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 not requiring initial hospitalization, , in terms of hospitalization needs, up to day 21 after randomization Primary endpoint: Proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 deterioration or World health organization died without hospitalization between day 1 and day 21. As an indicative basis, criteria for hospitalization will be the presence of any of the following: respiratory rate > 24 /min Anti Thrombin rest, Sp02 < 95% on room air, blood pressure < 100 mmHg, lethargy or unconsciousness, brutal overall deterioration or lethargy in the elderly [Haut Conseil à la Santé Publique] and any Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia other reasons requiring hospitalization left Anti Thrombin the discretion of the physician Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives : In adult patients diagnosed with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 not requiring initial hospitalization, to evaluate the impact of camostat mesylate compared to placebo on: - Safety up to day 21 - Efficacy in terms of need for hospitalization for COVID-19 management, by independent blinded committee review - Overall clinical improvement Anti Thrombin day 21 - Clinical efficacy in terms of intensive care needs, up to day 21 - Clinical efficacy in terms of time to hospitalization, up to day 21 - Clinical efficacy on respiratory functions, up to day 21 - Overall survival Anti Thrombin day 21 and 90 after randomization - Patient-reported outcome on initial symptoms, up to day 21 - Virological, serological and immunological efficacy, up to day 90, including surrogacy assessment of candidate markers up to day 90 - Renal complications, up to day 21 - Liver complications, up to day 21 - COVID-19 transmission within the same household Secondary endpoints : - Adverse events (AEs) : number of AEs, number of serious AEs (SAEs), investigational medication discontinuation (for any reason), up to 21 days - Independent endpoint adjudication committee-reviewed proportion of patients hospitalized between day 1 and day 21, for COVID-19 deterioration.

Investigational medicinal product(s): Camostat mesylate, oral administration 600mg/day (2 x 100mg every 8 hours) for 14 days (day 1 to day 14) Comparator treatment: Placebo tablets, following the same schedule as investigational drug Interventions added for the study: Oral medication (camostat mesylate or placebo). Expected benefits for the participants and for society: The trial will evaluate a candidate therapeutic strategy in the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics. Specifically, the proposed treatment targets ambulatory high-risk patients newly diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19, and not requiring initial hospitalization. The strategy aims to improve short-term outcomes in ambulatory patients and prevent clinical evolution to more severe forms, requiring hospitalization. intrathecal injection will therefore participate in reducing hospitalization needs (quantitative and qualitative and relieving the healthcare system) and may reduce contagiosity. Moreover, intrathecal injection can be a useful therapeutic option for ambulatory patients, with early diagnoses, in the management of the epidemics in the upcoming months and lockdown removal. Risks and burdens added by the study: Additional risks are those of camostat mesylate. Known side effects are : digestive (nausea, vomiting diarrhea) and hypersensitivity < 0.5%, cytopenias <0.1%, liver abnormal function and hyperkaliemia in <0.05% Risk level of the study : D Practical implementation: Patients will be screened from the consults of participating primary care general practitioners (GPs), 4 emergency departments (Saint Louis hospital, Bichat hospital, Mondor hospital and Argenteuil hospital), 2 hospital outpatientCOVID-19 screening center (Bichat hospital, Mondor hospital), outpatient consult of internal medicine Anti Thrombin Saint Louis hospital and of the Sickle Cell Disease and inherited Red Blood Cells genetic disorders, coordinating referral center. Anti Thrombin Henri Mondor hospital . Anti Thrombin the initial consult, patients will be screened for eligibility, with the standard of care sampling for SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR (nasal or saliva) or antigen test. Upon positive laboratory confirmation of COVID19, after information, eligible patients World health organization consent to participate to the trial will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: - Arm A: camostat mesylate 600mg (2x100mg/8h) (n=298) - Arm B: Placebo (2 tablets/8h) (n=298) Patients will be blinded to the treatment arm. After the inclusion visit, follow-up visits will be performed Anti Thrombin 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. Follow-up visits will include a medical interview (either in person or teleconsultation) and paramedical assessment by registered nurses with vital signs measurement and biological sampling. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia included patients will benefit from standard of care ambulatory monitoring for COVID-19. Biological monitoring (blood sampling for serum electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes) and virological monitoring (RT-PCR on nasal swab) on day 7, 14, 21 will be performed locally, following standard practice in primary care. Data will be collected via a web-based standardized electronic case report form. In case of hospitalization, the hospital report will be used as source for data collection by the general practitioner. Randomization will be performed centrally via a web-based system, to ensure allocation concealment, with the use of pre-specified randomization lists based on permutation blocks. Number of participants included: N=596 planned From the current knowledge on SARS-CoV2 infection in adults , we expect roughly 20% of newly diagnosed high-risk patients being hospitalized within 21 days (8). The design initially included a planned interim analysis after one third of observations had been completed. A maximum total sample size of 536 evaluable patients (268 per treatment group) would allow 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in the probability of hospitalization Anti Thrombin day 21 between groups (e.g. reduction from 20% to 10%), using a z-test, with one-sided 2.5%-significance level for efficacy, using Lan & DeMets risk-spending functions (O’Brien & Fleming boundaries approximation), for efficacy and futility stopping rules. Overall, 596 patients (298 in each group) would be included to anticipate a potential 10% drop-out rate, given the ambulatory follow-up. However, due to the status of the pandemics as of fall 2021 and global use of vaccines, the scientific comittee decided to stop recruitment to eventually discontinue the trial early. The planned interim sample size has not been reached. Eventually, only a single final analysis will be performed Anti Thrombin the 2.5% one-sided significance level, for the primary endpoints. Other endpoints will be analysed as planned.

    "page_content": "Full title: Evaluation of tomosynthesis in the characterization and management of breast Rationale: Tomosynthesis is an innovative technique developed in digital mammography for obtaining a sectional image of the breast. Mammography has the main disadvantage of being an imaging projection that creates overlays, which eliminates tomosynthesis. Objective and primary endpoint: Evaluate if BiRads classification obtained with tomosythesis is superior to classification obtained by conventional mammography in terms of specificity and non-inferior in terms of sensitivity. Joint analysis of true negative and false negative rates according to BiRads scale as compared to the histological results (or follow-up outcome, see “gold standard”, below) Objectives and secondary endpoints: Evaluate If tomosynthesis with synthetic tomography allows a better detection of certain signs of poor prognosis for malignant lesions (size and multicentricity of the tumour, lymph node extension, skin or pectoral infiltration). If tomosynthesis with synthetic tomography modifies the number of additional views and/or number of additional examinations including ultrasound, breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging and biopsy. assess whether tomosynthesis reduces the necessary number of ultrasound and compare the differences in ratings BIRADS obtained by tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography and then with ultrasound to the differences obtained with conventional mammography alone and then combined with ultrasound. If tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography changes the radiation dose received by the patient. If tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography improves the reproducibility of the BiRads classification for abnormalities. The costs analysis of tomosynthesis with synthetic mammography compared to mammography and/or mammography + ultrasound. Experimental design: A randomized multi-centric study (phase III diagnostic study according to the classification of Gluud & Gluud. (1) During the inclusion phase (18 months) a tomosynthesis system will be installed Anti Thrombin each site by the manufacturer. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients with a clinical or breast imaging abnormally Anti Thrombin each of these sites during the study period and having given informed consent will be randomized to either a conventional mammography or tomosynthesis (4 incidences) with synthetic mammography.

    "page_content": "Full title: Multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial assessing the benefit of adherent invasive E.coli eradication in adult ileal and ileo-colonic Crohn disease Scientific justification: Current medical treatment of Crohn disease (CD) consists of immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies). These agents control symptoms of CD in most patients but their withdrawal leads to disease relapse. They are also associated with serious side effects (infections, lymphoma, cancer, liver toxicity). Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies are the most efficient but are cost prohibitive. Moreover, each year, roughly 10% of responders to anti-TNF become refractory to treatment, most often because they become tolerized to these drugs. Future CD drugs are small molecules or biologics that antagonize pro-inflammatory cytokines or gut homing of lymphocytes. Yet, they have similar safety issues as the immunosuppressive agents currently in use. The current therapeutic algorithm for CD does not take into account the site of inflammation or composition of intestinal microbiota. Moreover, dysregulated intestinal immunity and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines are not the only components of CD pathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E. coli specie with adhesive and invasive properties, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in ileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in 36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls The role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated in several laboratories around the world and has shown that AIEC is pro-inflammatory and could play an important role in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As such, intrathecal injection may be an important therapeutic target. This randomized trial proposes a novel approach to the treatment of CD. intrathecal injection is individualized to patients colonized with AIEC World health organization will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics that have been shown to be active against the bacteria in vitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks. We hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients World health organization have been randomized into the experimental arm. If this trial is successful, intrathecal injection will be the first of its kind and will facilitate a new era of clinical research in patients with CD and concomitant infection with AIEC. Primary objective and assessment criterion: The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether a 12-week treatment with Ciprofloxacin and Rifaximin is superior to placebo to obtain endoscopic remission in AIEC-colonized patients with ileal CD, with or without involvement of the caecum or the right colon. The primary endpoint is the overall response Anti Thrombin week 12, using centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies. Overall response is defined by segmental response in Anti Thrombin least one segment in which the CDEIS was ≥8 Anti Thrombin baseline, with no more than 20% increase of CDEIS in the other segment and a CDEIS<8 in this segment. Segmental response in the segment in which the CDEIS was ≥8 Anti Thrombin baseline, is defined by: - In the case of isolated aphtoid ileitis and/or colitis: decrease ≥ 50% of lesions. - Otherwise, either decrease ≥ 50% of surface of ulcerations (either deep or superficial), or loss of deep ulcerations (if present Anti Thrombin inclusion) with no more than 20% increase in superficial ulcerated surface. Secondary objectives and assessment criteria: The secondary objectives are: To test the correlation between endoscopic remission and AIEC eradication Anti Thrombin 12 weeks, To assess the evolution of endoscopic lesions Anti Thrombin week 12, To assess the rate of clinical remission without steroids, anti-TNF, and surgery Anti Thrombin 48 weeks, in patients whose AIEC has, or has not been eradicated, and in patients World health organization have, or have not, reached the primary endpoint, To assess the rate of biological remission, during the study, To assess side effects in the experimental and placebo group. The secondary endpoints are : Endoscopic remission Anti Thrombin 12 weeks (assessed by centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies), defined by a CDEIS < 6 in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia the segments Mean variation of segmental CDEIS, Anti Thrombin 12 weeks (centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies), Complete endoscopic remission Anti Thrombin 12 weeks (centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies) defined by a CDEIS <3, in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia the segments No ulceration Anti Thrombin 12 weeks, Clinical remission as defined by CDAI<150 without steroids, anti-TNF, and resection surgery for CD Anti Thrombin 12 and/or 48 week, Biological remission as defined C Reactive protein serum level ≤5 Milligrams/L and fecal calprotectin <250 μg/g Anti Thrombin week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, Side effects. Experimental design: This is a phase II clinical trial. intrathecal injection is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled adaptive clinical trial, with two parallel arms: Experimental arm: oral Ciprofloxacin 500 Milligrams Twice a day and oral Rifaximin 800 Milligrams Twice a day for 12 weeks Control arm: a placebo of Ciprofloxacin Twice a day and a placebo of Rifaximin Twice a day for 12 weeks Population involved: CD adult patients infected with AIEC. Preinclusion criteria: Age 18 to 75 years CD of the ileum, with or without involvement of the caecum or the right colon Most severe lesions are confined within the ileum and/or the right colon.

Treatment being tested: Association of two antibiotics: Oral Ciprofloxacin, tablets of 500 Milligrams, every 12 hours during 12 weeks Oral Rifaximin (tablets of 200 Milligrams), 800 Milligrams every 12 hours during 12 weeks Benchmark treatment: Association of two placebos: A placebo corresponding to each antibiotic will be manufactured (tablet of the same appearance). intrathecal injection will be administrated every 12 hours during 12 weeks. Other procedures added by the research: Ciprofloxacin and Rifaximin or their placebos 6 additional biopsies, including 4 biopsies of the ileum or the right colon (2 for the AIEC search and 2 for the biological collection) and 2 biopsies of the rectum (for AIEC search) during the 1st ileocolonoscopy Ileocolonoscopy Anti Thrombin week 12 including 6 additional biopsies Study of fecal microbiota using PCR 16S Screening for fecal AIEC lpf+ Risks added by the research: Risk C Practical procedure: 252 patients with CD will screened to realize biopsies to check for infection by AIEC bacteria. 62 evaluable patients are anticipated. These are patients infected with this bacterium and responding to the eligibility criteria of the study. They will be included in the study and randomized to the experimental arm (Rifaximin+Ciprofloxacin) or control (double placebo) arm. An ileocolonoscopy and biopsies will be made Anti Thrombin week 12, to research AIEC infection and thereby assess the eradication of the bacteria after taking the study drugs or placebos.

    "page_content": "Full title: Multicenter, randomized, prospective trial comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab to that of Tocilizumab in severe uveitis of Behçet’s disease Scientific justification: UVB, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to Tocilizumab in sight threatening uveitis of BD. Anti-TNF has been used for BD uveitis for 15 years. The incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction therapy in severe BD uveitis. BD uveitis is considered as the most devastating inflammatory ocular disease. Risk of visual loss reaches 25% Anti Thrombin 5 years and 80% of patients have a bilateral involvement. Contrasting with immunosuppressors or interferon-alpha, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. However, anti-Tumor necrosis factor alpha failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of severe sight threatening uveitis. There is little published information on use of biologics other than anti-TNF for severe BD uveitis. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. IL-6 expression correlates with BD activity and other immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with tocilizumab. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in BD, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists. Main objective and primary endpoint: To assess the benefit of tocilizumab comparatively to that of adalimumab in sight-threatening Behçet’s disease uveitis Anti Thrombin week 16 Primary Endpoint: Efficacy will be defined by a complete remission of ocular involvement (complete resolution of retinal vasculitis and/or macular edema) with prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) lower or equal to 5 Milligrams/day Anti Thrombin week 16 after randomization.

Birth control methods which may be considered as highly effective methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods (according to CTFG recommendations). Such methods include: For female subjects : combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral intravaginal transdermal progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral injectable implantable intrauterine device (Intrauterine device) intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) bilateral tubal occlusion vasectomised partner sexual abstinence (In the context of this guidance sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). For male subjects : use of a condom vasectomy (with documentation of azoospermia) sexual abstinence Negative Tuberculosis test obtained within 12 weeks prior to inclusion.

Anti-TNF is a rapidly acting agent when compared to methylprednisolone or interferon alpha in suppressing ocular inflammation. However, they failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of patients. Also, TNFa antagonists seems to have suspensive effect on ocular inflammation in BD. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. Rapid onset of action and steroid-sparing effect characterize the efficacy of tocilizumab. Nowadays, the management of severe BD still remains largely empirical. This is the first randomized, head to head, study for therapeutic management of severe uveitis in BD with biologics. This study may assess the benefit of tocilizumab comparatively to that of adalimumab in sight-threatening Behçet’s disease in terms of safety, efficacy and steroid sparing. intrathecal injection could thus improve the care of patients with BD and with uveitis in general. The expected benefit is both individual, in reducing morbidity and rate of blindness for young patients with BD, and collective, in reducing costs of hospitalization, and of dependence. Risks and burdens added by the study: Risks associated with the toxicities of the investigational drugs Risks associated with use of contrast medium for retinal angiography The risk level of the study : Risk C Practical implementation: After the collection of their free and informed consent, eligible patients with active sight threatening Behçet’s disease uveitis will be randomized into one of 2 groups Anti Thrombin the randomization visit (Day 0): • Arm A (Adalimumab) 80mg Anti Thrombin Day 0 then 40 Milligrams subcutaneously Anti Thrombin week 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 • Arm B (Tocilizumab) 162mg subcutaneously every week for 15 weeks Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia treatment groups will receive the same corticosteroid regimen. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive oral prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) Anti Thrombin 1 Milligrams/Kilograms/day (up to 80 Milligrams/day) Anti Thrombin randomization. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive: • 1 Milligrams/Kilograms/day (maximum 80 Milligrams/d) week Day 0-Week 4, • 40 Milligrams/day Week 4-Week 6 • 30 Milligrams/day Week 6-Week 8, • 20 Milligrams/day Week 8-Week 10, • 15 Milligrams/day Week 10-Week 12, • 10 Milligrams/day Week 12-Week 14, • 5 Milligrams/day Week 14-Week 16, Dose of corticosteroids will be left Anti Thrombin the investigator discretion after Week 16 Number of participants included: 60 patients (30 patients in each arm) Number of sites: Multicenter national study including 26 centers Duration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period (treatment+follow-up): 12 months Total duration: 48 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,07 Statistical analysis: The experimental design is an open multicenter randomized clinical trial stratified on the characteristics of the initial uveitis in Behçet’s disease : retinal inflammation (retinal vascularitis and/or macular edema) and according to the diagnosis (newly diagnosed or relapsing disease), with evaluation of the primary assessment criteria Anti Thrombin 16 weeks. The primary assessment criteria will be reviewed by a scientific committee blinded of the randomization. The RCT will use a Bayesian design for phase II randomized national multicenter clinical trial that aims Anti Thrombin comparing a new treatment to a reference based on a binary endpoint (i.e. complete remission Anti Thrombin week 16), which offers greater flexibility and simplicity of inference to the monitoring for patient safety and evidence of efficacy of small randomized trials. intrathecal injection will use a Beta-Binomial model with a non-informative prior (Berry 2006). The posterior probability that the remission rate is Anti Thrombin least 0.65 will be estimated in both arms, and the probability that the rate of remission in Arm B is above that in Arm A will be computed, with B indicating the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group. We will use a Bayesian inference framework, where denotes the probability of remission in the arm A. After inclusion of nA patient in Arm A and yA complete remission observed. Using a beta Be(,) prior for , the posterior probability of is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. In our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm A will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment remission rate”. intrathecal injection has been set Anti Thrombin 0.65 in this trial. Thus, we will compute Similar analyses will be performed in arm B. However, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of experimental treatments. Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the other by some targeted minimal level. This will be done by computing the posterior probability of the difference in remission rates between the two experimental arms (Kawasaki in 2012) being greater than zero, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group: As we consider a Bayesian design an interim analysis will be performed without any “alpha spending“ after inclusion of 30 patients. If >0.80, >0.80 and if >0.80. The trial will be stopped. If <0.10 or <0.10 the corresponding arm will be stopped and the following patients will be included in the other arm. If <0.10 and <0.10, the trial will be stopped.",

    "page_content": "Full title: A multicenter, randomized, multi-arm trial comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab, Anakinra and Tocilizumab in Subjects with Non-infectious Refractory Uveitis Scientific justification: RUBI, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to either anakinra, or tocilizumab in refractory Neutrophil Immune Unit. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory Neutrophil Immune Unit. Neutrophil Immune Unit can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal blindness. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of refractory/relapsing severe uveitis. The incidence of blindness in Neutrophil Immune Unit has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious uveitis. Contrasting with immunosuppressors, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in uveitis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists. Primary objective and assessment criterion: Primary Objective • To evaluate the efficacy of Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days) compared to anakinra (100mg/day) and tocilizumab (162mg/7 days) in subjects with refractory non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan- uveitis (Neutrophil Immune Unit) and with a prednisone dose 0.1 Milligrams/Kilograms/day of prednisone (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) Anti Thrombin Week 16. Primary Endpoint • Efficacy measured by the Percentage of patients with Anti Thrombin least 2-step reduction in Vitreous Haze (according to Miami 9-step Scale) and with a dose 0.1 Milligrams/Kilograms/day of prednisone (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) Anti Thrombin Week 16. Secondary objectives and assessment criteria: Secondary Objectives • To evaluate the change in best corrected visual acuity (Best corrected visual acuity). • To evaluate the safety of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab in patients with Neutrophil Immune Unit. • To evaluate the change in macular edema. • To evaluate the change in other signs of ocular inflammation. • To evaluate the effect on retinal vessel leakage. • To evaluate the effect of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab on steroid sparing. • To evaluate the change in ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber. • To evaluate the effect on underlying systemic disease when appropriate. • To evaluate the effect on ocular disease. • To evaluate the number and time to relapse of uveitis and the characteristics of uveitis Anti Thrombin worsening. • To evaluate the time to treatment failure Secondary Endpoints, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia measured Anti Thrombin 16 weeks • Best corrected visual acuity (Best corrected visual acuity). • Change in macular edema. • Change in other signs of ocular inflammation. • Retinal vessel leakage. • Steroid sparing. • Ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber. • Underlying systemic disease when appropriate. • Ocular disease. • Number and time to relapse of uveitis and the characteristics of uveitis Anti Thrombin worsening. • Adverse events • Time to treatment failure Experimental design: This is a prospective phase II clinical trial, multicenter, multi-arm, randomized (1:1:1) clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab in subjects with active and refractory non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis. Oral corticosteroids should be Anti Thrombin a stable dose 30 days prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0.

Stage III and intravenous infusion New York Heart Association (“New York Heart Association”) cardiac insufficiency Treatment being tested: Eligible patients with active and refractory Neutrophil Immune Unit will randomized Anti Thrombin 1:1:1 ratio between Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks Arm 2: Anakinra (100 Milligrams/day subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks Arm 3: Tocilizumab (162 Milligrams/7 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks. The three treatment groups will receive the same corticosteroid regimen. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients with Neutrophil Immune Unit will receive oral prednisone 0.5 Milligrams/Kilograms/day with a maximum of 40 Milligrams/day of prednisone or equivalence. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive: - 0.5 Milligrams/Kilograms/day of prednisone until week 4. - 0.4 Milligrams/ Kilograms/day of prednisone from week 4 to week 6 - 0.3 Milligrams/ Kilograms/day of prednisone from week 6 to week 8. - 0.2 Milligrams/ Kilograms/day of prednisone from week 8 to week 12 - ≤0.1 Milligrams/ Kilograms/day of prednisone from week 12 to week 16. Due to the CSI recommendation of the 18/06/2019, inclusion in the Anakinra arm has been stopped and the investigational medicinal product Anakinra has been discontinued in patients undergoing follow-up. Thus we modified the planned analyses and the randomisation accordingly. After the inclusion and randomisation of 54 patients, the next patients will be randomized 1:1 either in the 2 remaining arms: • Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks • Arm 3: Tocilizumab (162 Milligrams/7 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks. In practice, intrathecal injection means that the remaining 66 planned patients will be randomized (33 in arm 1 and 33 in arm 3). Other procedures added by the research: - Ophthalmologic visit Anti Thrombin weeks 8 and 16 - Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiogram (FA/ICG) Anti Thrombin week 16 and ocular coherence tomography (Optical coherence tomography) Anti Thrombin weeks 8 and 16 Risks added by the research: Risk C Practical procedure: The randomization will be stratified by retinal vasculitis, macular oedema and underlying disease. Anti Thrombin randomization, the patient will be under treatment with prednisone. One study eye will be selected. If both eyes are eligible for the study (as per inclusion/exclusion criteria) the following rules will be respected: • The eye with active disease will be selected versus the eye with recently active disease, as defined by the protocol. • If both eyes present active disease documented by the same unique parameter, the eye with the worse score will be selected. • If both eyes present active disease defined by several parameters, the eye with the worse score ranked as follows will be selected: 1 Vitreous Haze; 2 cystoid macular edema (CME); 3 retinal vascular leakage and 4 best corrected visual acuity (Best corrected visual acuity). If both eyes have an equivalent score, the right eye will be selected. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive ocular coherence tomography (Optical coherence tomography) Anti Thrombin enrolment, month 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 and a fluorescein and indocyanine green angiogram (FA/ICG) Anti Thrombin enrolment, month 2 and 4 or Anti Thrombin Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia visits in case of vasculitis or worsening. Number of subjects chosen: 120 Number of centres: 37 departments of 17 French public hospitals Research period: Duration of inclusions: 56 months Duration of participation of each patient: 7 months maximum Total duration of the study: 63 months Number of inclusions expected per centre and per month: 0.4 patient/month/centre Statistical analysis: We will use a Bayesian Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS) design that aim Anti Thrombin comparing several new treatments (multi-arm), in order to select or drop any treatment arm to move forward when such evidence already exists based on interim analyses The randomization will be stratified by retinal vasculitis, macular oedema and underlying disease. Anti Thrombin randomization, the patient will be under treatment with prednisone as single therapy.",

    "page_content": "Full title: Multicenter, randomized, prospective trial comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab to that of Cyclophosphamide in severe Behçet’s disease Scientific justification: ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to that of cyclophophamide in severe manifestations of BD. Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Therape utic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular, or neurological involvement. Early recognition and vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological involvement. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However, the outcome of severe complications of BD is still poor. The European League Against Rheumatism (European League Against Rheumatism) recommendation (updated in 2016) for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNF plus glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel involvement) but recommendations on vascular disease and neurological involvement are based largely on expert opinion and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies. The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent.. TNFa antagonists have been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases. In addition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of anti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD manifestations. Physicians are still prescribing these compounds off-label use. We therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in severe and difficult to treat BD patients. Main objective and primary endpoint: To assess the benefit of infliximab comparatively to that of cyclophosphamide in severe life-threatening Behçet’s disease. Primary assessment criterion will be the complete clinical response Anti Thrombin week 22 after randomization Secondary objectives and endpoints: To estimate and compare the rate and time to occurrence of relapses or worsening To estimate and compare the cumulative dose of steroids To estimate and compare the adverse events To estimate and compare the mean change in The Short Form (36) Health Survey quality-of-life (see Appendix 3) To estimate and compare the rate of remission according to organs involved To compare the changes in acute-phase reactants, To estimate and compare the changes in Central Nervous System involvement To estimate and compare the changes in Cardio-vascular involvement Survival and event free survival To estimate and compare the changes in other BD manifestations To estimate and compare the changes in Behcet’s Disease Current Activity Form (see Appendix 2) To assess serum concentration measurement of TNFa inhibitor Secondary endpoints - Complete clinical response Anti Thrombin week 12 and 48. - Remission of Central Nervous System and/or cardiovascular involvement Anti Thrombin week 12, 22 and 48. - Measures of corticosteroid sparing : o Percent meeting targets [≤ 0.1 Milligrams/day/Kilograms of prednisone] Anti Thrombin week 22 and 48. o Mean dose Anti Thrombin week 12, 22 and 48. o Cumulative dose Anti Thrombin week 12, 22 and 48. - Time to response onset - Measures of acute-phase reactant : o C-reactive protein [C Reactive protein]) every 4 weeks - Relapse : o Time to relapse (Relapse will be defined as the reappearance of clinical and/or paraclinical features of active disease or by the occurrence of new lesions Anti Thrombin week 48. o Rate of relapse - Worsening o Time to occurrence of worsening.

    "page_content": "Full title: Efficacy of 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in kidney transplant recipients, a multicentre randomized non-inferiority trial. Scientific justification: Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. In kidney transplant recipients (KTR) urinary tract infection (UTI) represent 45–72% of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia infections, and 30% of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia hospitalizations for sepsis. Acute transplant pyelonephritis are the most common complications occurring in more than 20% of patients, mainly in the first year after transplantation. They are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney rejection and long-term kidney graft dysfunction. Gram-negative bacteria, mainly E. coli, account for more than 70% of UTI in KTR. As those infections are favored by urinary tract modifications/defects and immunosuppression, they are often recurrent and necessitate repeated courses of antibiotics. Selective pressure due to antibiotic consumption, along with frequent hospital admissions and immunosuppression, are well known risk factors for the development of antibiotic resistant infections. Multidrug (MDR)- or extensively (XDR)- drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae including ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing organisms, are thus increasingly observed in transplant units and represent a global threat as very few new antibiotics are expected in the next decade. One main strategy to limit antimicrobial resistance is to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment. A 7 day-course is recommended for simple acute pyelonephritis (APN) treated with fluoroquinolones or parenteral B-lactams, prolonged up to 10 or 14 days in the presence of underlying disease Anti Thrombin risk of complications. Most KT teams treat patients between 14–21 days as recommended by American guidelines. However, the need to extend treatment duration in immunosuppressed patients is a poorly defined concept and the optimal duration of treatment for APN in KTR is not known as these patients are excluded from most studies. As there is an urgent need to reduce antibiotic consumption in this population Anti Thrombin high risk of developing infections due to resistant pathogens, the hypothesis is that a 7 day-treatment is sufficient to cure APN with good clinical response after 48h of treatment in KTR and is as effective as 14 days. Main objective and primary endpoint: To show that a 7 day-antibiotic therapy is not inferior to a 14 day-antibiotic therapy in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in kidney transplant recipients. Primary endpoint: Clinical cure and no additional antibiotic treatment since the end of antibiotic treatment up to the main evaluation Anti Thrombin day 30. Clinical cure is defined as fever <38°C and no symptoms of UTI. Secondary objectives and endpoints: To compare between both arms: -Clinical cure Anti Thrombin day 90 and day 180 -Microbiological cure Anti Thrombin day 30, 90 and 180 -Tolerance and safety of antibiotics -Hospitalization length stay -Antibiotic consumption during total follow up -Acquisition of antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae -Kidney graft function and transplant rejection Anti Thrombin day 90 and day 180 - The total costs. To evaluate risk factors for failure and relapse/recurrence. To evaluate efficacy of the antibiotic treatment Anti Thrombin the end of treatment (Day 7 for experimental arm and Day 14 for control group) Secondary endpoints: - Clinical cure Anti Thrombin day 90 and 180 - Microbiological cure *Anti Thrombin day 30, 90 and 180 - Incidence of relapse /recurrence between day 30 and day 90 - Incidence of adverse events imputable to antibiotic treatment - Kidney function assessed according to MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) or CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration) epi - Hospitalization length stay defined by the delay between the date of inclusion and the date of hospital discharge - Antibiotic consumption - Rectal carriage of antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae Anti Thrombin inclusion and day 30 *Microbiological cure is defined as a sterile urine or uropathogene ≤ 103 CFU/mL in urine culture. Design of the trial: Multicenter, controlled, randomized, non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (1:1): 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The randomization will be stratified by date of renal transplantation (≤ 1 year and > 1 year), center and sex (potential confounders). Population of trial subjects: KTR with acute pyelonephritis Inclusion criteria: -Age >18 years KTR -APN defined by: fever (T°≥38°C) (with or without clinical signs and/or symptoms of UTI) and pyuria (≥104 white blood cells/mL or ≥10/Cubic millimeter) and positive urine culture (uropathogen ≥103 CFU/mL susceptible to the empirically administrated antibiotic) -No confirmed or suspected febrile non urinary bacterial infection -No urologic/renal complication Anti Thrombin baseline imaging (abscess, obstruction...) - Favourable early response to antibiotic treatment:( 48 to 60 hours after the first dose of antibiotic effective against the causative uropathogen) defined by: T°<38°C and improvement (or resolution) of signs and/or symptoms of urinary tract infection if present Anti Thrombin diagnosis. - Written informed consent Exclusion criteria: Patients with any of the following conditions: -Severe or complicated condition - Any rapidly progressing disease or immediately life-threatening illness, including, but not limited to, septic shock, current or impeding respiratory failure, acute heart or liver failure - Admission or stay in intensive care unit Anti Thrombin baseline - Obstruction of the urinary tract - Renal, perinephric or prostatic abscess - prior inclusion in this study - current participation to another interventional study -Dual antibiotic therapy ((prophylactic antibiotic such as cotrimoxazole allowed) )(only 1 dose of aminoside is allowed before randomization) -First month post transplantation -Current indwelling catheter (including bladder catheter, ureteral stents, percutaneous nephrostomy tubes) -Neurogenic bladder -Enterocystoplasty -Immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive therapy not related to kidney transplantation, including hematologic malignancy, cancer, asplenia, neutropenia<500 neutrophils/Cubic millimeter, -Pregnancy, breastfeeding -Hypersensitivity or previous severe adverse drug reaction to the antibiotic therapy -Unable or unwilling, in the judgment of the investigator, to comply with the protocol -Life expectancy<1 month -Patient under legal guardianship or without healthcare coverage -Homeless patient -Women with childbearing potential not using adequate contraception Comparator treatment: Standard (14 days) antibiotic duration Interventions added for the trial: 2 swabs for bacterial resistance rectal carriage study and 1 follow-up consultation will be added to the standard procedure Risks added by the trial: UTI could relapse more frequently in the short duration arm if non inferiority is not demonstrated. This will require a new antibiotic treatment for the patient. Scope of the trial: Phase intravenous infusion trial Number of subjects included: 470 Number of sites: 10 Duration of the trial: Length of participation to the study: 6 months Length of Inclusion period: 36 months Total study duration: 42 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 1-2 Statistical analysis: Sample sizes of 235 in each group achieve 80% power to detect a non-inferiority margin difference between the group proportions of -0.05. The reference group proportion is 0.95. The treatment group proportion is assumed to be 0.90 under the null hypothesis of inferiority. The power was computed for the case the actual treatment group proportion is 0.90. The test statistic used is the one-sided Z test (unpooled). The significance level of the test is 0.05",

    "page_content": "Name of the study: CAALL-F01: a French protocol for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) in children and adolescents Main backgrounds: 1. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is now a curable disease in 80-90% of children and 70-80% of the adolescents. Nevertheless numerous problems remain These good results are obtained with intensive and prolonged treatments which include risk of toxic death, sequelae, and secondary malignancies. Results are still insufficient for high-risk forms, particularly those exhibiting an early resistance to chemotherapy Early bone marrow relapses (less than 30 months after diagnosis) still have a dismal prognosis which renders their prevention mandatory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of biology and response to treatment. To envisage targeted treatments in the future renders key to decipher this heterogeneity. The two cooperative groups FRALLE and the French centers of the EORTC-CLCG have decided to elaborate a common protocol for the treatment of childhood and adolescent Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Childhood and Adolescent Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-France- 01(CAALL-F01). The two previous studies from these groups have comparable results: 2. A still major question in the field of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is the optimal use of L-asparaginase (ASNase) intrathecal injection is known that administering ASNase results in the depletion of asparagine circulating in the blood, which starves the leukemic cells and results in their death. But indeed the use of ASNase varies between protocols considering the different brands, the dose and the administration modalities (rythm, route-intramuscular or intravenous infusion). Three major forms of ASNase are currently available: E. coli asparaginase (Kidrolase® in France), Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase®, for patients with allergy) and a pegylated form of E.coli Asparaginase (Oncaspar® in USA and in Europe). 2.1.Oncaspar®in the USA Oncaspar® (PEGylated E. coli asparaginase or pegaspargase manufactured initially by ENZON and now SHIRE/Servier) was developed with the goal of reducing the immunogenicity of the native ASNase. In addition, Oncaspar®, because of its prolonged serum terminal half-life (t1/2), can be dosed less frequently than native ASNase with achievement of similar Pharmacodynamic. In the USA, CCG-1962 was the pivotal clinical trial supporting first-line use of Oncaspar®. Children with standard risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (n=118) were randomized to receive native or PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient from Merck) as part of induction and 2 delayed intensifications (DI) phases. Oncaspar® was administered intramuscularly (intramuscular) Anti Thrombin a dose of 2,500 IU/Month 2 once during the 4-week induction phase and once during each of two 8-week DI phases. Native E. coli asparaginase from Merck (Elspar®) was administered intramuscular Anti Thrombin a dose of 6,000 IU/Month 2 three times weekly for 9 doses during induction and for 6 doses during each DI phase. Children treated with Oncaspar® had a more rapid clearance of lymphoblasts from Day 7 and Day 14 bone marrow aspirates and a more prolonged asparaginase activity than those treated with the native form. In the first DI phase, 26% of native asparaginase patients had high-titer antibodies compared to 2% of those patients receiving Oncaspar©. High titer antibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not the Oncaspar® arm. The rate of infections, hospitalizations and the safety profile were similar between the arms (Avramis others., 2002). Oncaspar® is approved for the treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia as a component of multi-agent chemotherapy in the USA since 1994, including for first-line use since 2006. This first line use has been transferred to a “new” Oncaspar® manufactured by Sigma-tau (pegaspargase; asparaginase from Lonza) in 2011, and now by SHIRE. 2.2. Oncaspar® in Europe Until now, Oncaspar®, currently available in Europe differed from the Oncaspar® marketed in the USA in terms of the asparaginase origin (Kyowa-Hakko v. Lonza), although both products are pegylated by Sigma-Tau in the USA. In Germany and Poland, Oncaspar KH (Kyowa-Hakko) is registered as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy for reinduction in patients with a known hypersensitivity to native L-asparaginase (second-line). Oncaspar KH has been used as the first line asparaginase preparation in Anti Thrombin least three European Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia protocols: UK MRC protocols for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia since 2003 (UK), BFM-AIEOP protocol for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia since 2010 (Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland; Czech Republic, Israel), INTERFANT (a protocol dedicated to infants with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) since 2006 (many countries). Since January 2016, the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization for use of ONCASPAR as a combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) in pediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients. With this approval, Baxalta is authorized to market ONCASPAR in the 28 member countries of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. This authorization is related to the Oncaspar incorporating the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient manufactured by Lonza. This authorization has been transferred to the subsequent owners : Shire and currently Servier 2.3 Current status of asparaginase preparations in France Until January 2016, only Kidrolase® was registered for first line use. Erwinase® is available for patients that are allergic to native or pegylated asparaginase (MAA in France: 30.03.2015). Oncaspar ® (Oncaspar KH) was available only under a named patient program (ATUOn 19 November 2015) until Oncaspar ® received a marketing authorization on january 2016. 3. Different dosing and schedules using ONCASPAR® during induction therapy are currently proposed according to first-line Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia protocols opened Anti Thrombin that date. - 2500 IU/Month 2 one infusion: COG and DFCI protocols (US) (using ONCASPAR LONZA) - 3500 IU/Month 2 one infusion: St Jude protocol (US) (ONCASPAR LONZA) - 2500 IU/Month 2 two infusions: AIEOP-BFM protocol (Europe)(ONCASPAR KH) - 2500 IU/ Month 2 two infusions: EORTC protocol (Belgium) (ONCASPAR KH) - 2500 IU/ Month 2 one infusion: Interfant 06 protocol (mainly Europe)(ONCASPAR KH) - 1000 IU/Month 2 two infusions: UKALL protocol (UK)(ONCASPAR KH) - 1500 IU/Month 2 two infusions: DCOG protocol (NL)(ONCASPAR KH) 4. The results of the 2003 Protocol UKALL are interesting: event-free survival 86% Anti Thrombin 5 years, overall survival Anti Thrombin 5 years 92% (Vora A others, Lancet Oncol 2013 and 2014). They have been obtained by using a low dosage per infusion of Oncaspar KH (1000 IU/Month 2 intramuscular) but repeated Anti Thrombin 15 day intervals for induction. In a subgroup of 482 patients treated in UKALL 2003, CYK Fong others (ASH 2011) show that the dose that provides adequate asparaginase activity (> 100 IU/L) in 86% of samples studied after the 1st and second injection. Questions asked in the CAALL-F01 protocol: This French protocol will be the first in Europe to use the ONCASPAR® LONZA used in the USA since 2012 (first approval in 1994 was for another “ONCASPAR® manufactured with a Merck Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient). Randomized question: what is the best way to administer pegaspargase? A cohort of children and adolescents with standard or medium risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia will be randomized to receive during induction either one infusion of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) 2500 IU/Month 2 Anti Thrombin Day 12 or two infusions of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) Anti Thrombin 1250 IU/Month 2 each Anti Thrombin Day 12 and Day 26. Patients will then receive 2500 IU/Month 2 or 1250 IU/Month 2 per dose during consolidation and delayed intensification according to the initial arm of randomization. Non randomized question: In the High/Very High Risk groups, a non randomized intensification of the scheme of asparaginase administration is proposed during induction therapy: 2 infusions of 2500 IU/Month 2/day (Day 12 and Day 26) will be administered. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive 2500 IU/Month 2 per dose during consolidation and delayed intensifications. Primary objectives: For children and adolescents with standard or medium risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, the study has two primary objectives: 1) to assess the superiority in terms of Pharmacokinetic Anti Thrombin Day 33 of the fractionated scheme; 2) to assess the equivalence in the tolerance of the 2 schemes (from Day 12 of induction to Day 49) In the High/Very High Risk group two primary objectives have been defined: 1) to assess the Pharmacokinetic Anti Thrombin Day 33; 2) to assess the toxicity of the intensified scheme from Day 12 of induction to Day 49 Main end-points: Adequate asparaginase activity (>100 IU/L) Anti Thrombin Day 33 of induction Toxicity: Incidence of severe toxicities (Grade ≥ 3) directly asparaginase-related (Central Nervous System thrombosis, pancreatitis, anaphylaxia, and hyperbilirubinemia) between Day 12 and Day 49 of treatment and anyway before Day 8 of consolidation Secondary end-points: 1. Linked to the study Drug PHARMACOKINETICS/ PHARMACODYNAMICS /IMMUNOGENICITY: A comparison of the 2 arms will be made for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups. The criteria will include: Asparaginase activity and asparagine levels Anti Thrombin defined time-points Incidence of asparaginase antibodies Incidence of silent inactivation in both arms during induction, consolidation and intensification phase(s) Allergic reaction rate in both arms during induction, consolidation and intensification phase(s) Percentage of patients without switch to Erwinia asparaginase Percentage of patients receiving more than 95% of the intended dose of asparaginase EFFICACY A comparison of the 2 arms will be made for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups. The criteria for efficacy will include: Morphological complete remission rates assessed on the whole population or on subgroups (B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). Minimal Residual Disease (minimal residual disease) Anti Thrombin the end of induction (TP1) and Anti Thrombin the later time-point (TP2)(TP3 for a subgroup of patients) assessed by Ig/TCR-based RQ-PCR. This evaluation will be made in the whole population and within subgroups Cumulative Incidence of relapses Cumulative Incidence of Bone Marrow relapses, Central Nervous System relapses, gonadal relapses, combined relapses TOXICITY A comparison of the 2 arms will be undertaken for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia other adverse events (Adverse Event) related to asparaginase occurring within the first 7 weeks (Day 49) of treatment and anyway before Day 8 of consolidation: Hyperglycemia / induced diabetes, coagulopathy, allergy, hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia) Non Central Nervous System thrombosis Grade 1-2 Adverse Event: pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, Adverse events related to asparaginase but occurring after Day 49 of induction or anyway Anti Thrombin Day 8 of consolidation or after Incidence of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia grade 3-4 adverse events, whatever their imputability. SURVIVAL TIME-POINTS 5-year event-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival are classical outcome measures for the evaluation of survival in children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Event-free survival is the survival time free of treatment failure, relapse or secondary malignancy from Day 1 of treatment or after randomization (in randomized arms); disease-free survival is the event-free survival in responders measured from the time of complete remission following induction. Treatment failure is defined after induction Anti Thrombin day 35-day 42, by Anti Thrombin least 5% blasts and minimal residual disease >= 5x10-2. In case of no available minimal residual disease, only the >=5% blasts criterion will be required. 2-other secondary objectives to evaluate the incidence of rare subgroups of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and their prognostic value e.g. so-called “B-other” subgroup: BCR-ABL like (including EBF1-PDGFRB), MEF2D-X, ZNF384-X, TCF3-HLF… 5 year event-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival of the rare patients with suboptimal response to therapy (induction failure or MRDTP1 ≥ 10-3) and ABL-class fusions ALLs treated with imatinib Imatinib related adverse events (immediate and long term, cf appendix 9) in the rare patients with suboptimal response to therapy (induction failure or MRDTP1 ≥ 10-3) and ABL-class fusions ALLs treated with imatinib Definitions: National Cancer Institute Standard-risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia criteria) B-cell precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 365 days < age <10 years White Blood Cell Count < 50 Giga /liter National Cancer Institute High-risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia B-cell precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia age > 10 years or White Blood Cell Count ≥ 50 Giga /liter T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia of the T-cell lineage Central Nervous System involvement: CNS3 status, according to current standard definitions for CNS1, CNS2, CNS3, and traumatic lumbar puncture (Traumatic Lumbar Punction) Testis involvement: clinical enlargement of one or both testes confirmed by ultrasonography Prednisone response (measured Anti Thrombin Day 8 of induction therapy): Good prednisone response (GPR): less than 1000 blast cells/Cubic millimeter after 7 days of Prednisone 60 Milligrams/Month 2/day and one intrathecal injection of methotrexate Poor Prednisone response (PPR): no good prednisone response Minimal residual disease (minimal residual disease) (measured after induction and during or after consolidation): evaluation by Real time -Quantitative PCR after search for two Ig/TCR markers if possible or Anti Thrombin least one with a minimum sensitivity of 10-4, according to the ESG-minimal residual disease recommendations. No detectable minimal residual disease means no signal with Anti Thrombin least one marker Anti Thrombin the 10-4 sensitivity level. In case of failure (less than 10% of the cases) a Flow Cytometry evaluation of minimal residual disease will be done in a reference centre.

Patients will be allocated either to receive one infusion of Oncaspar® 2500 IU/Month 2 vs. or 2 infusions of 1250 IU/Month 2 during induction therapy. The dose per infusion after induction therapy is the dose per infusion attributed by the initial randomization No randomized question will be asked in the high/very high risk groups of the B and T lineage, these patients receiving 2 infusions of Oncaspar® 2500 IU/Month 2 during induction and 2500 IU/Month 2/infusion afterwards. Nevertheless, these patients will be submitted to the same evaluation in terms of Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic, toxicity and efficacy. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will be included in the CAALL-F01 study before Day 8 of induction treatment. Randomization will take place between Day 8 and Day 11, i.e. 1-4 days before the first infusion of pegaspargase (Day 12), for patients belonging to the B-Standard Risk/B-Medium Risk/T-Standard Risk groups.

    "page_content": "Full title: Phase II multicentric study of pembrolizumab in classic or endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma Scientific justification: Classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) are lymphangioproliferations associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies give Anti Thrombin best 30-60% of transient responses. While  interferon responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic KS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since patients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive regimens nor antiviral therapies. Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently been shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS few data are available on the role of PD1-Pharmacodynamic-L1 axis. A significant Pharmacodynamic-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of this pathway with expression of Pharmacodynamic-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of Pharmacodynamic-L1 by tumor cells in KS lesions. In this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS. Primary objective and assessment criterion: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design : The main objective is to assess whether pembrolizumab is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<5%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>30%) in classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), using the Simon’s 2 stage Optimal Design. The primary endpoint will be the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response following ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if intrathecal injection occurs before 6 months. Extension stage: In case of truly active conclusion of the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design, an extension stage would be performed to assess more precisely the efficacy of pembrolizumab in our setting. 20 more patients will be included to obtain a more precise estimation of the treatment effect up to 24 months. The primary endpoint of this extension stage will be the Best overall response rate according to ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if intrathecal injection occurs before 6 months. Patients included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design, will be followed until 24 months. Secondary objectives and assessment criteria: Secondary objectives are: (for Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design and Extension stage) to assess the safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma, to characterize the efficacy of pembrolizumab related to pharmacodynamics assessment Secondary endpoints: Efficacy endpoints Different aspects of clinical response will be evaluated: Best overall response rate according to Physical Global Assessment (PGA) score until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if intrathecal injection occurs before 6 months.

After 6 months of Pembrolizumab treatment (Cycle 8), if the complete response is observed and confirmed during Anti Thrombin least 1 month, the Pembrolizumab will be stopped. Benchmark treatment: Uncontrolled trial Other procedures added by the research: Pharmacodynamic evaluations will be based on tumor tissue collection (cutaneous biopsy) and correlative blood sampling Risks added by the research: Risk C Practical procedure: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 Milligrams intraveinously every 3 weeks and will be assessed for drug safety and efficacy. Patients will continue on treatment for 6 months unless they experience disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. The treatment period can be extended up to 3 months in case of study delay due to Adverse Event that have been resolved Extension Stage: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients included in the extension stage will receive pembrolizumab 200 Milligrams intraveinously every 3 weeks and will be assessed for drug safety and efficacy. Patients will continue on treatment for 24 months unless they experience disease progression, unacceptable adverse events or confirmed complete response occurring after 6 months of treatment and lasting for Anti Thrombin least 1 month. Number of subjects chosen: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design 9 patients will be enrolled in the first part of the study with another 8 patients in the second part (total 17 patients). intrathecal injection implies have to screen a maximum of 34 patients. Extension stage: 20 additional patients will be enrolled. Number of centers: Multicenter French study For Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: 8 participating centers of the French National Group “Groupe de Cancérologie Cutanée”. For the Extension stage: 11 participating centers of the French National Group “Groupe de Cancérologie Cutanée” Research period: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: Duration of inclusion: 18 months Duration of participation (treatment and follow up): 11 months maximum (1 month of selection, 6 months (8 cycles) of treatment that can be extended up to 3 months in case of study delay due to Adverse Event that have been resolved,1 month of follow-up). Extension Stage: Duration of inclusion: 24 months Duration of participation (treatment and follow up): 37 months maximum (1 month of screening/inclusion period Anti Thrombin most, 24 months (35 cycles) of treatment that can be extended up to 3 months in case of study delay due to Adverse Event that have been resolved, 12 months of follow- up). otal duration including the extension stage : months Number of inclusions expected per centre and per month: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: AP-HP, Saint Louis: 6 AP-HP, Avicenne: 2 AP-HP Cochin: 2 AP-HP, Bichat: 2 CHRU de Lille: 1 Centre hospitalier Lyon sud: 2 CHRU Montpellier– Hôpital Saint-Eloi: 1 CHU Grenoble: 1 Extension Stage: AP-HP, Saint Louis: 10 AP-HP, Avicenne: 2 AP-HP Cochin: 0-1 AP-HP, Bichat: 2 CHRU de Lille: 0-1 Centre hospitalier Lyon sud: 2 CHRU Montpellier– Hôpital Saint-Eloi: 0-1 CHU Grenoble: 0-1 CHU Marseille : 0-1 CHU Toulouse : 0-1 CH Nice : 0-1 Statistical analysis: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: This is a multicenter uncontrolled phase II study, based on a 2- stage phase II Simon’s Optimal Design. Sample size computation was based on statistical hypotheses with regards to treatment effect on the main endpoint, best overall response rate. With a 0.05 type I error and a 90% statistical power, the sample size was computed to assess whether the drug is inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<5%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>30%). Based on our hypotheses, intrathecal injection was computed that 9 patients would be accrued in stage 1. If necessary inclusion will be stopped during 6 months after the 9th inclusion waiting for the primary endpoint. The trial will stop with conclusion of inactivity if no response is observed in this stage; otherwise, 8 additional patients will be recruited to a total sample size of 17 patients, with Anti Thrombin least 3 responses to indicate that the drug is effective enough. In case an observed response before the end of stage 1 the stage 2 will directly begin without any stop. Extension Stage: Only the 20 patients included in the extension stage will be considered in this main analysis. With an expected complete best overall response rate (complete response, partial response) Anti Thrombin 24 months of 14/20 (70%), we would obtain a 95%CI interval of the complete response rate equal to [46%;88%]. A secondary analysis will be performed on the 20 patients included in the extension stage plus the 17 patients included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design. With an expected best overall response rate Anti Thrombin 6 months of 26/37 (70.3%), this analysis will reach a 95%CI interval of the complete response rate equal to [53%;84%].",

    "page_content": "Full title: Treatment of severe refractory systemic lupus erythematosus by injection of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord Scientific justification: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory Disease (Autoimmune Disease), affecting both sexes and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monocolonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in Autoimmune Disease patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies. Scientific justification: According to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, Mesenchymal Stem cells (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells) have been proposed as a new therapy for several Autoimmune Disease, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (professor Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature) in China. intrathecal injection is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Paris, clinical expert center for cell therapy in Autoimmune Disease, and University College London for cell manufacturing. Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: To assess the tolerance of allogeneic umbilical cord derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells administration for severe SLE refractory to standard therapies (cyclophosphamide mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids with or without anti CD20) Primary endpoint: Immediate tolerance as assessed during the first injection and 10 days after the allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells injection, according to standards Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events side effects. Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives : Feasibility of allogeneic UC-Mesenchymal Stromal Cells administration in the treatment of severe SLE subjects refractory to conventional therapies Tolerance three months after injection, considering the observed morbidity and the overall survival in SLE treated subjects until 1 year after the procedure. Analysis of biological and clinical response on routine clinical and biological examination and criteria for monitoring lupus using SELENA SLEDAI-, BILAG, SF36, EQ5D, SRI, SLICC-SLE scores.

    "page_content": "Full title: Randomized prospective trial evaluating the efficacy of the antiCD38 monoclonal antibody isatuximab in the treatment of PCRA by major ABO mismatch after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Scientific justification: A quarter of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are performed in a situation of major ABO mismatch exposing patients to the risk of immunological pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after transplant. PCRA after transplant is defined as anemia with low reticulocytes count (under 10 Giga /liter) after day 60 despite good leucocytes and platelet engraftment, full donor chimerism, associated with the persistence of recipients hemagglutinins (anti-A or anti-B antibodies). Bone marrow evaluation when performed show erythroid hypoplasia. Red blood cells transfusions are necessary every two weeks until remission leading to impaired quality of life (anemia, repeated hospitalization), iron overload, and need for iron chelation therapy. Treatments currently used are inefficient (anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies, EPO, steroids, plasma exchanges, proteasome inhibitors) or Anti Thrombin risk of severe acute Graft versus host disease (donor lymphocytes infusion). PRCA has been demonstrated to be associated with the persistence of recipient’s plasma cells. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies which targets plasma cells secreting hemagglutinins responsible of PCRA are a promising treatment: 6 cases reported in the literature support a rapid and sustain efficacy (Chapuy, NEJM, 2018 Bathini, AmJHematol, 2019, Rautenberg, BMT, 2019 Salas others.

    "page_content": "Full title: Evaluation of long-term health status and quality of life in adult survivors with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma treated with an intensive pediatric or pediatric-inspired-inspired protocol. Scientific justification: The overall survival of adult patients (15-59y) with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LL) was dramatically improved by the use of full pediatric or pediatric-inspired protocols (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that aimed to reduce the risk of relapse by adopting more intensive chemotherapeutical schedule. This approach led to a global improvement in overall survival (5y-overall survival, 57%) whatever patient age but was responsible for an excess of treatment-related mortality in patients older than 45 years (5y-TRM in patients > 45y, 19%). Pediatric longitudinal studies pointed out that long term leukemia survivors have an increased risk of developing specific adverse events like dysmetabolic syndrome, obesity, decreased fertility, organ dysfunction, osseous events, or impaired cognitive functions. This study aims to evaluate the impact in term of long-term events and Quality of life in adult patients that received an intensified therapeutic approach recently implemented in adult cooperative groups. Main objective and primary endpoint: To evaluate the prevalence of late effects in adult patients treated 10 years ago for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LL with an intensified pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that exposed patients to increased cumulative doses of chemotherapy, central nervous system irradiation or w/o allogeneic transplant after total body irradiation-based regimen w/o boost irradiation on central nevous system. The primary endpoint is thus defined by the prevalence of adverse events, including : - metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes) - osseous events / osteoporosis - cardiac and vascular troubles - neurologic troubles - lung dysfunctions - endocrinal troubles - ophthalmological troubles - fertility disorders - secondary neoplasia Secondary objectives and endpoints: - To evaluate the quality of life of these patients, - To correlate the prevalence of late effect or Quality of life status with previous social situation, previous medical condition to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Treatment schemes including administration of protocols phases (delayed intensification, maintenance), central-nervous system irradiation, allogeneic SCT, graft-versus host disease occurrence. , - To elaborate risk-adapted recommendations for the long-term follow-up of adult patients treated for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with reinforced therapeutic strategies. The secondary endpoints are thus - the prevalence of metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes), - the prevalence of osseous events / osteoporosis, - the prevalence of cardiac and vascular troubles, - the prevalence of neurologic troubles, - the prevalence of lung dysfunctions, - the prevalence of endocrinal troubles, - the Quality of Life (The Short Form (36) Health Survey) - the prevalence of ophthalmological troubles - the prevalence of fertility disorders - the prevalence of secondary neoplasia Design of the study: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, interventional minimal risks and constraints human research study Population of study participants: Adult patients aged 15-59y Anti Thrombin diagnosis treated ten years ago for a Ph1-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LL) Inclusion criteria: - Patient with Philadelphia-negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or LL treated in or according to a pediatric-like or pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL or FRALLE) with or without allogeneic transplant. - Patients older than 15 years old and less than 60 years old Anti Thrombin diagnosis - Patient with a follow-up from first complete remission of more than 10 years, - Patient World health organization gave informed signed consent for baseline examination Exclusion criteria: - Patient World health organization experienced Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/LL relapse within the 5 past years. - Philadelphia positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients Interventions or product under investigation: None Other interventions added by the study: - hormons tests - antral follicle count by US - Questionnaire Expected benefits for the participants and for society: An expected individual benefit, since systematic reviews can be used to detect and take early care the late complications related to treatment Minimal risks and constraints added by the study: None Scope of the study: Risk minimal (A) Number of participants included: 300 Number of sites: Approximatively 36 centers of the GRAALL network Schedule for the study: State: - inclusion period: 66 months - participation period: 9 months - total duration of the study : 75 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 300 patients / 36 sites 66 months inclusion period = <1 patients/month/ site Statistical analysis: The analysis will handle the left data truncation (given only patients World health organization survive until 2016 are able to be included in the study). Approximately 1000 patients were included in the GRAALL-2003 and 2005, among them 630 before August 2009. Considering that 363/630 patients were alive Anti Thrombin last follow-up, the opportunity to include patients treated according to these protocols, and a 80% inclusion success, approximately 300 patients will be recruited. This allows assessing the prevalence of troubles with a 95%CI width Anti Thrombin 7% about assuming a 10% prevalence or to 0.10 assuming a 30% prevalence, and detection of OR Anti Thrombin 2.5 or 2, respectively. This also allows reaching a statistical power of Anti Thrombin least 80% for detecting OR Anti Thrombin 2.",

    "page_content": "Full title: Phase I/II randomized clinical trial of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells systemic infusion in severe systemic sclerosis Scientific justification: Systemic sclerosis (Systemic Sclerosis) is a rare, severe and chronic systemic autoimmune disease (Autoimmune Disease) characterized by vasculopathy, immune dysregulation and fibrosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction (primarily skin, lungs, heart gastrointestinal tract and kidneys), with high morbidity and mortality, altered health-related quality of life, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Anti Thrombin high cost for patients and society. Treatment are mostly symptomatic and only autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) has shown long term improvement in overall and event-free survival with disease-modifying properties. However, Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation is contra-indicated in case of advanced visceral involvement and in eligible patients, intrathecal injection is still associated with risk of toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective treatments for severe Systemic Sclerosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells) are multipotent cells which carry immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties, that can target Systemic Sclerosis pathogenesis and its clinical manifestations. The increasing use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells, harvested from bone marrow (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M)), adipose tissue (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin)), or umbilical cord (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(UC)) in a variety of indications, provides consistent evidence supporting their safety in humans. The efficacy of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M) intravenous (intravenous infusion) injection for treating acute graft versus host disease led to their marketing approval in 2012 and Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) (Alofisel) were approved for severe Crohn’s fistula in 2018. Mesenchymal Stromal Cells represent a promising therapeutic approach for Systemic Sclerosis. We have previously a) shown disease-specific abnormalities in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M) from Systemic Sclerosis patients, providing strong rationale to use allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells to treat Systemic Sclerosis patients, b) published the first phase I/II dose escalation trial using allogenic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M) infusion in 20 severe Systemic Sclerosis patients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02213705, programme hospitalier de recherche clinique AOM 11-250) with no safety issues, significant improvement in skin fibrosis Anti Thrombin 3 to 6 months after infusion which appeared lower thereafter, thereby supporting the need for repeated infusions. In vitro, experimental and clinical studies suggest that Mesenchymal Stromal Cells properties vary according to their tissue of origin/source. We demonstrated that compared to Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M), Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) are easier to harvest and display higher proliferative capability before entering senescence, higher genetic stability, and superior immunosuppressive properties. Considering the above rationale, we hypothesize that use of healthy donors allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) produced by Etablissement Français du Sang (event-free survival) will demonstrate a) no safety issues, b) an efficacy profile that will increase with repeated infusion of allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) to treat Systemic Sclerosis Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: To evaluate the safety one month after allogeneic 2x106 Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin)/Kilograms intravenous administration once or twice Anti Thrombin 3 months interval (Month 0, Month 3) in severe Systemic Sclerosis patients Primary endpoint: The rate of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (severe adverse event) defined as Adverse Events (Adverse Event) of grade equal or above 3 using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0 classification, Anti Thrombin one month after each infusion (Month 1, Month 4). Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia adverse events will be adjudicated by a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives: Safety during the infusion, within the first 24 hours of infusion and during Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia study follow-up. Efficacy signals to inform future studies, using outcome measures on skin sclerosis, lung function and quality of life, previously validated in Systemic Sclerosis or used in other cell therapy trials.

Comparator treatment: Placebo Interventions added for the study: - Administration of Allogeneic Adipose tissue derived-MSCs (Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin)) (1 or two injections) or placebo (1 or two injections). - Supplementary visits (1 month after each injection) with basic blood and urine evaluation - Supplementary blood sampling for eligibility evaluation (infectious serology, β-HCG for women), advanced immunophenotyping and alloimmunisation investigations for baseline and follow-up evaluations, and constitution of a biological samples collection - Skin biopsies (optional) Anti Thrombin Month 0, Month 3 and Month 6 - Patient notebook for the cost-effectiveness analysis Expected benefits for the participants and for society: Based on strong experimental data (CoPI K Tarte) and the published results by our team in 20 severe Systemic Sclerosis patients previously treated by a single intravenous infusion allogeneic Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(M) infusion in NCT02213705 trial, there is strong rationale that Systemic Sclerosis patient symptoms will be improved after Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) treatment, with Anti Thrombin least fibrosis skin score regression and lung function stabilization Anti Thrombin 3 to 6 months. Results from the proposed trial will be used to inform a larger Phase II-III multi-center trial of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) in Systemic Sclerosis and other clinical trials in auto-immune diseases, with the potential to accelerate the treatment of Systemic Sclerosis patients and to allow France playing a leadership role in regenerative medicine for Autoimmune Disease and fibrotic diseases. Risks and burdens added by the study: The increasing use of MSCs in a wide variety of therapeutic indications currently provides a wealth of data in favour of their safety in humans. There are no foreseeable serious adverse effects associated with the injection of MSCs. Some transient benign adverse reactions, linked to the procedure for injecting the cells or the placebo, may occur.

Duration of the study: - Inclusion period: 12 months - Participation period (treatment + follow-up): 12 months plus possibly 3 months additional follow-up for patients in the placebo arm (arm 0) or arm 1 World health organization will have chosen the opportunity to receive one or two Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) injection Anti Thrombin the end of the study after unblinding and once evidence of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) injection safety is provided (up to 2 months between unblinding and Mesenchymal Stromal Cells(Anti Thrombin) injection). Total duration: 29 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,5 inclusion, per site, per month Statistical analysis: We propose to conduct a multi-center, three-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We will enroll a total of 18 Systemic Sclerosis patients. Each patient will be 1:1:1 randomized to one of two treatment arms (1 infusion of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (Month 0) or 2 infusions of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (Month 0, Month 3))or a placebo arm (total of 6 patients per arm, using randomization block of size 6). Inclusions will be staggered, to allow the detection of severe adverse event prior to inclusion of subsequent patients, according to the following waiting rules: - Anti Thrombin least one week between two consecutive randomizations - interval of Anti Thrombin least one month every three randomizations Continuous monitoring of the primary endpoint by the sponsor will be implemented to allow continuous Bayesian toxicity monitoring with a stopping rule implemented on the primary endpoint on cell infusions (see section 13 for details): - first analysis on the first 3 patients with completed Month 1 visits, - then analysis Anti Thrombin any TRSAE Anti Thrombin Month 1 or Month 4 visits - final analysis. The stopping rule will be defined based on the estimated probability that the risk of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (TRSAE) is >15%. “criterion 1” = the probability that the a posteriori probability of severe adverse event is > 15%. The posterior probability of TRSAE (πtrsae) will be estimated using a Bayesian approach with a beta density. The stopping rule will be fulfilled if criterion 1 > 0.70 (meaning that we have a high probability that there is a greater than 15% risk of TRSAE). Interim analyses results will be presented to the Data safety monitoring board for their recommendation. In the case of early stopping, subsequent patients will not be randomized and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients treated thus far will be followed up and results analyzed as described below. There is no formal statistical test for sample size in a Bayesian framework. Nevertheless, one can invoke the frequentist framework to anticipate the expected precision in terms of safety. Indeed, after 18 infusions (6 patients with 1 infusion, 6 patients with 2 infusions), we will be able to estimate a risk of Severe Adverse Events (severe adverse event) of 10% with a width of the exact 95% confidence interval equal to 32% considering independence between infusions.",

    "page_content": "Full title: A prospective multicenter trial comparing allogeneic matched related haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen, with standard of care in adolescents and adults with severe sickle cell disease Scientific justification: Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has dramatically improved over the last decades in the US and Europe, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many children and most adults develop a chronic debilitating condition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) is currently the unique curative approach; intrathecal injection allows the cure of more than 95% of children transplanted from a matched related donor (minimal residual disease) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen(1),(2). To date, few studies have addressed the role of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in SCD adults, due to the risk of graft versus host disease (Graft versus host disease) and to the toxicity expected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage. The development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid Graft versus host disease appears as an attractive option for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation to cure adults with severe SCD. Four groups have previously reported encouraging results in a total of 81 patients transplanted from matched related mobilized peripheral blood cells after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab and low dose of total body irradiation (Total Body Irradiation)) followed by post-transplant sirolimus. These studies demonstrate a high SCD free survival rate (no death related to transplant, 6 graft failures) and no Graft versus host disease. Ninety two percent of these patients were cured with normalized hemoglobin levels, resolution of hemolysis and stable hemoglobin A levels identical to the proportion observed in the donor(3–6). However, outcome comparison of patients transplanted with patients not transplanted are lacking. We design a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15 years with severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative transplant (when a matched related donor (minimal residual disease) is identified) versus no Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (for patients lacking minimal residual disease). Main objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is to assess the benefit of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation on the 2-year event free survival calculated from inclusion, compared to standard care. The primary endpoint is the 2-year event free survival. An event is defined as: death from any cause or an acute grade II-intravenous infusion Graft versus host disease according to the Magic consortium 2016 (Appendix 20.3) or a moderate or severe chronic Graft versus host disease according to the NIH classification, or 3 hospitalizations for VOC defined according to usual criteria or one ACS defined by usual clinical criteria and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest film and/or thoracic computed-tomography (CT) scan or a stroke defined as a clinical event confirmed by an Magnetic Resonance Imaging or a cerebral or cervical stenosis > 25% in a new territory, evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MRA or increased of Anti Thrombin least +10% of tricuspid regurgitation velocity, (confirmed by 2 echocardiographies performed with a delay of Anti Thrombin least 3 months) compared with pre-inclusion value for patients with TRV ≥ 2.7 Anti Thrombin inclusion or apparition of a silent infarct or a cerebral/cervical stenosis >25% in a new territory, or increase >25% of previous stenosis evaluated Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MRA We hypothesize that the 2-year event free survival will be of 80% after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation versus 40% in the no-transplant group. Secondary objectives and endpoints: The secondary objectives: Compare in the both groups Anti Thrombin 2 years: Overall survival Total days requiring hospitalization after the first 5 months post-inclusion. Acute complications of SCD: VOC, ACS, priapism Stroke, silent infarct, cerebral or cervical stenosis on MRA/Magnetic Resonance Imaging Hemolytic index, hematologic and biochemical parameters Organ function (kidney, eyes, heart, lung, liver, bone) Grade III-intravenous infusion Infectious complications Need for transfusion from 6 months post-inclusion Alloimmunization rate Iron overload Chronic used of oral opioids Nutritional involvement Gonadic function and fertility Quality of life, anxiety and depression Cost Study of Red Blood Cells and White Blood Cell Count adherence To evaluate in the transplant group: chimerism, engraftment, Graft versus host disease, patients free of sirolimus Anti Thrombin 1 and 2 year post-transplant The secondary end points: Death Number of days requiring hospitalization with exclusion of the 5 first months post-inclusion Clinical adverse events: number of VOC and ACS requiring hospitalization, number of hospitalization in intensive care unit Number of priapism Number of stroke Changes in biological parameters: LDH, aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, professor, APTT, hemoglobin level, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, percentage of hemoglobin variants, reticulocyte, white blood cells and platelets counts, estimated glomerular function rate Microalbuminuria/creatininuria ratio Ferritin and transferrin saturation level Gonadic function: Spermogram in men, LH, FSH, oestrogen in women, testosterone in men Anti Thrombin Month 24; Number of amenorrhea in women.

Interventions or product under investigation: Patients should be transplanted within 1 to 6 months of inclusion. Human Leukocyte Antigen Matched related Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Red-cell exchange will be performed to reduce hemoglobin S levels to 30% or less before the preparative regimen. Consider fertility preservation techniques according patient’s age, pregnancy wish and evaluation of ovarian function The conditioning regimen will consist in 300cGY Total Body Irradiation Anti Thrombin D-2 and alemtuzumab intravenous infusion (Total dose: 1mg/Kilograms) for 5 days (D-7 to D-3) The stem cell source will be G-Cerebro Spinal Fluid mobilized peripheral blood stem cells. CD34 target dose is 10 x 106 or more per Kilograms body weight. If the number of CD34 cells is not obtained after one leukapheresis, a second will be planned the next day to reach the goal. Graft versus host disease prophylaxis with consisted in sirolimus for 1 year, then sirolimus will be tapered and stopped Anti Thrombin 15 months post-transplant. Comparator arm: Patients will receive the best standard care according to their situation and their previous treatment: initiation of Hydroxyurea, continuation or optimization of the dose of Hydroxyurea, initiation or continuation of Time Point, initiation of a new drug proved to improve SCD and having authorization to use in France. Other interventions added by the study: Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Expected benefits for the participants and for society: In the transplant arm, the benefit expected is the cure of the disease, i.e. absence of post-transplant new complications related to SCD. Risks added by the study: In the no transplant arm, the risks are the complications of the disease despite supportive care including hydroxyurea and transfusions programs. Chronic transfusions can lead iron overload and alloimmunization. Hydroxyurea can lead hypofertility. In this arm: consultation every 3 months until Month 24. In the transplant arm: Hospitalization for 4 to 6 weeks followed by weekly consultations during the 3 first months post-transplant, then 1 monthly consultation from 3-6 months and consultation every 3 months until Month 24. Some of the most common toxicities associated with the transplantation (including the reduced conditioning regimen and Graft versus host disease prophylaxis) are: Graft versus host disease according to the Magic consortium 2016 (Appendix 20.3) criteria Chronic Graft versus host disease according to the NIH classification Infection Fever, aplasia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombopenia, anemia Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting Cardiovascular: arterial hypertension Neurological disorders: visual disorders Miscellaneous: serum sickness (skin rashes, pain and swelling of the joints) and anaphylaxis (hypotension, difficulty breathing and severe hives, mucositis) Transplant may potentially lead transplant related mortality and graft versus host disease, but no case was observed in the first 81 cases reported in the literature. The risk of long term complications as infertility remains to be evaluated in this setting of RIC transplant. Scope of the study: Hematology/Haemovigilance and therapeutic transfusion Number of participants included: 78 patients Number of valued sites: 30 centres: 19 recruiting centres and 11 transplant centres (some recruiting site, also transplant patients) Schedule for the study: State: inclusion period: 3 years participation period (treatment+follow-up): 2 years total duration of the study: 5 years Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 2 patients expected per recruiting site per year Statistical analysis: A single efficacy analysis is planned: event-free survival will be compared between two groups using log-rank test, and the effect of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation assessed by Hazard Ratio using a Cox model. The primary endpoint is event free survival Anti Thrombin 2 years calculated from inclusion. Event will be defined as followed: death from any cause or an acute grade II-intravenous infusion Graft versus host disease according to the Magic consortium 2016 (Appendix 20.3) or a moderate or severe chronic Graft versus host disease according to the NIH classification, or 3 hospitalizations for VOC defined according to usual criteria or one ACS defined by usual clinical criteria and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest film and/or thoracic computed-tomography (CT) scan or a stroke defined as a clinical event confirmed by an Magnetic Resonance Imaging or a cerebral or cervical stenosis > 25% in a new territory, evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MRA or increased of Anti Thrombin least +10% of tricuspid regurgitation velocity, (confirmed by 2 echocardiographies performed with a delay of Anti Thrombin least 3 months) compared with pre-inclusion value for patients with TRV ≥ 2.7 Anti Thrombin inclusion or apparition of a silent infarct or a cerebral/cervical stenosis >25% in a new territory, or increase >25% of previous stenosis evaluated Magnetic Resonance Imaging and MRA Event free survival Anti Thrombin 2 years calculated from inclusion will also be described in the Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation group. Overall survival will be defined as the time between date of inclusion and death due to any cause or to date of last follow-up. A propensity score matching analysis will be also performed as a sensitivity analysis to handle potential residual imbalances between arms in confounders. A sequential analysis of tolerance data will be performed, using Bayesian methods. We hypothesize that the 2-year event free survival will be of 80% after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation versus 40% in the no-transplant group.",

    "page_content": "Full title: Multicenter randomized double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of belimumab in the treatment of non-infectious active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis compared to placebo Scientific justification: Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and requires therapeutic intervention. The management of noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on corticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade, several groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved effective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete clinical response in 65-70% of patients. However, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40% patients within few days to nineteen months after the last rituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown that serum BLys concentration was correlated with serum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In agreement with data in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, we also observed decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining which was correlated with disease severity. Following rituximab serum BLys concentration significantly increased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B cell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A recent study has shown that rituximab does not reset defective early B cell tolerance checkpoints. An obvious solution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from precipitating a flare of disease following rituximab therapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of disease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF blockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and BAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone and follicular compartments more effectively than either treatment alone. A combination of B cell depletion and BAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone with respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts and plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity, in three different mouse models of lupus. In addition, promising results have been observed in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis treated by rituximab plus belimumab and with good safety profile. Main objective and primary endpoint: To evaluate efficacy of belimumab compared to placebo in patients with non-infectious active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.

Group II: Placebo of Belimumab administered subcutaneously weekly from Week 1 to week 24. Randomization will be centralized, stratified on previous treatment history (naive patients versus relapsing patients) and the severity of vasculitis (i.e. extensive skins necrosis, glomerulonephritis, multiple mononeuropathy, myocarditis, digestive or central nervous system specific involvement) in a 1:1 ratio between groups. Both groups will have the same corticosteroid tapering scheme, with an initial dose of 30 Milligrams/day. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive: 30 Milligrams/day week (W)0-Week 2, 20 Milligrams/day Week 2-Week 4 15 Milligrams/day Week 4-Week 6, 10 Milligrams/day Week 6-Week 8, 5 Milligrams/day Week 8-Week 10, Between Week 10-Week 12 the strategy for stopping glucocorticoids is left to the investigator's discretion Stopping glucocorticoid therapy Anti Thrombin Week 12 Anti Thrombin each step, the prednisone dose will be reduced only in the absence of signs of vasculitis activity. Number of subjects included: 48 patients, 24 patients in each arm Number of sites: Multicentre national study including 20 centres Duration of the trial: Duration of inclusions: 36 months Duration of participation of each patient:12 months Duration of treatment : 24 weeks Total duration: 48 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.06 patient/month/centre Statistical analysis: This is a Bayesian Phase II randomized clinical trial that aims Anti Thrombin evaluating the treatment strategy of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, based on difference in the response rate as measured Anti Thrombin week 25 after randomization. Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources. This design is adapted to binary outcomes observed Anti Thrombin the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements. We thus used the approach for phase II randomized trials proposed by Simon R, Wittes RE, and Ellenberg SS that aims Anti Thrombin controlling the probability of detecting a given difference in response rates. We hypothesize that up to 70% of the patients receiving placebo of belimumab and 85% of those treated by belimumab will achieve a complete remission of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis Anti Thrombin week 25 (Week 25) and with steroid therapy stopped (0 Milligrams/day) Anti Thrombin Week 12.",

    "page_content": "Full title: Phase II multicenter study of talimogene laherparepvec in classic or endemic Kaposi sarcoma Scientific justification: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted by immunosuppression. Human immunodeficiency virus-related KS and iatrogenic posttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration, in association with local or systemic therapies as chemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and endemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression cannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified, mostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS. Most aggressive forms with visceral involvement are treated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give Anti Thrombin best 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well tolerated in elderly patients. Talimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or unresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or cutaneous lesions. intrathecal injection is designed to induce tumor regression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects, and of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic antitumor immunity. In Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with Pharmacodynamic-1/Pharmacodynamic-L1 axis inhibitors have proven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that immunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors. Two cases of metastatic MCC succesfully treated with talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an effective therapeutic option. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the cutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec. Main objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is to assess whether talimogene laherparepvec is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<10%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>40%) in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma. The primary endpoint is the best overall response rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response of the injected lesions following PGA criteria (PGA 0 to 4) recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific therapy for Kaposi sarcoma if intrathecal injection occurs before 6 months. Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives: - Safety profile of talimogene laherparepvec in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma - Other parameters of efficacy (best response, response rate, duration of response) - Efficacy on injected and uninjected lesions - Quality of life Exploratory objectives - To characterize the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec related to immunologic and viral assessment on tumor biopsies and blood samples Secondary endpoints: - Adverse events (following the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0) - BORR according to the ACTG criteria, response rate Anti Thrombin month 3 and 6, response rate on lymphedema, time to response, duration of response - Response on injected and uninjected target lesions - Deaths from any cause - KS-adapted DLQI score Exploratory endpoints: - Characterize the immune tumor infiltrate (immune cells quantification), viral infiltrate and tumor necrosis before and after treatment - HHV8 viral load in blood and tumor cells; HHV8 sequencing Design of the trial: Phase II multicentre single arm open label trial Population of trial subjects: Adult patients Inclusion criteria: - Classic or endemic histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS) that is progressive, but does not require a systemic therapy ; - Injectable and measurable disease, defined as: Anti Thrombin least 2 cutaneous lesion ≥10mm in its largest diameter, in a not previously irradiated field; Anti Thrombin least 2 other cutaneous lesion ≥10mm in their largest diameter available for repeated cutaneous biopsies, in a not previously irradiated field.

However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully Human Leukocyte Antigen-MUD for the non-Caucasian population. Alternative donors (single Human Leukocyte Antigen mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from haploidentical related donors) are still associated with higher non-relapse mortality and delayed immune reconstitution. A more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which targets alloreactive T cells generated early after an Human Leukocyte Antigen-mismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and leaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil. From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are associated with similar overall and progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (Graft versus host disease), and thus potentially better results than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning regimen. A phase III randomized trial is currently addressing this question in France for elderly patients using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (HaploMUDelederly-01 /programme hospitalier de recherche clinique-K 14-045 / principal investigator: D Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes). A randomized prospective Phase III clinical trial comparing Human Leukocyte Antigen 10/10 MUD and haplo-SCT after myeloablative conditioning regimen is urgently needed to answer to this question. Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: to improve the 1-year progression free survival, without acute grade II-intravenous infusion Graft versus host disease and without moderate or severe chronic Graft versus host disease, using of the haplo donor compared with 10/10-Human Leukocyte Antigen MUD after myeloablative SCT. Primary endpoint: a 1-year progression free survival without Grade II-intravenous infusion acute Graft versus host disease and without moderate or severe chronic Graft versus host disease of 65% after haplo SCT versus 50% after 10/10-Human Leukocyte Antigen MUD. Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives: 1) to compare the two arms in terms of clinical and biological outcomes: Kinetic of haematopoietic reconstitution and Graft failure, Graft versus host disease, progression free survival, relapse, non relapse mortality, overall survival, Interval between inclusion and transplant Rehospitalizations Treatment related morbidity Quality of life Chimerism Immune reconstitution 2) to search for prognostic factors of the main outcome globally and in each arm 3) to search for treatment-by-covariate interactions on the main outcome Secondary endpoints: Interval between inclusion and transplant Absolue numbers of neutrophils and platelets Anti Thrombin Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12.

Blood sample for biobanking (Month 1) Risks added by the trial: Risks are related to the SCT itself, not to the randomization (haplo or MUD arm). There is no risk difference between both arms. Scope of the trial: Our goal is to show a superiority of haplo-SCT (primary endpoint) but even if similar results between both arms are obtained, this study might revolutionize the strategy of SCT since haplo donors will be used in priority compared with MUD (quick procedure, cheaper, and available for almost Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients). Number of subjects included: 344 Number of sites: 36 centres Duration of the trial: Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period : 24 months Total duration: 60 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.4 patient/month/centre Statistical analysis: Justification of sample size We hypothesize the 1-year progression free survival without Grade II-intravenous infusion acute Graft versus host disease and without moderate or severe chronic Graft versus host disease will be of 65% after haplo SCT versus 50% after 10/10-Human Leukocyte Antigen MUD. 172 patients in both arms (n=344 overall) are required to demonstrate such a difference, based on a two-sided logrank test,  = 0.05 and power = 0.80 (High Risk= 0.62), with a required total number of events of 146.

    "page_content": "Full title: Evaluation of an optimized allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation protocol with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in patients aged 40 to 60 years old with acquired aplastic anemia refractory or in relapse after immunosuppression Scientific justification: Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) is a major therapeutic option for patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Improved survival has been achieved in patients younger than 40 years old, thanks to better donor selection, conditioning regimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, together with improved supportive care. However, this has never been the case for patients over the age of 40 for whom the overall survival after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation never exceeded 60% Anti Thrombin 5 years using available sibling or unrelated donor (Ref#3). Thus, the standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) associating cisclosporine, horse anti-thymocyte globuline, together with the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG) is now considered as the standard of care in adult patients older than 40 years with AA (ref#1). Indeed, outcomes for patients World health organization are refractory to first-line IST remain poor because of the lack of other non-transplant treatment and because of the poor results of transplantation Anti Thrombin this age (Ref#2, 37). During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in this population after initial IST but risk of hemorrhage and long-term fatigue are still present. Moreover, clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis for MDS/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (Ref#2). The overall survival of such adult patients with acquired AA refractory or in relapse after IST outside Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation is thus about 60% Anti Thrombin 2 years (ref #2). Recently, new strategies to prevent acute and chronic graft versus host disease, including T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have revolutionized the field. These changes extended the option of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation primary for patients with refractory/relapse AA World health organization lack an Human Leukocyte Antigen matched donor (Ref#4). More recently the optimized Baltimore protocol using PTCy strategy also appears to improve engraftment and reduce graft versus host disease (Graft versus host disease) in other more classical setting (sibling and matched unrelated Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation outside AA) (Ref#5). One of the first cause of death after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in patients older than 40 years of age with refractory/relapse AA is Graft versus host disease and the use of the optimized Baltimore protocol for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia type of donors (haplo but also sibling and matched unrelated transplantation) within the field of AA rapidly appears promising (Ref#6&7). Using an optimized Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation procedure (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent drastically Graft versus host disease and eventually be practice changing. Evaluating this new transplant protocol as a new strategy is the main objective of “APARR”. Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: To demonstrate a benefit in terms of the 2-year GRFS (Graft Versus Host Disease {Graft versus host disease} and primary and secondary graft failure-Free Survival) from 50% (historical rates in patients with refractory/relapse AA undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (REF#8) up to 70% using an optimized Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation procedure (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) on patients over 40 years old and not only in haplo-identical donor setting. Primary endpoint: 2-year GRFS following HCST This primary composite endpoint is measured as the time from Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation to the first of the following events: primary and secondary graft failures, grade 3-4 acute Graft versus host disease, severe chronic Graft versus host disease and death. Secondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives To demonstrate a benefit in terms of clinical and biological outcomes: - primary and secondary graft failure - mortality, overall survival - quality of life -treatment related morbidity and notably severe infections, cardiac toxicities - chimerism - immune reconstitution Secondary endpoints 100-day engraftment (3 consecutive days with neutrophiles >0.5 Giga /liter and 7 consecutive days with platelets >20 Giga /liter) with donor chimerism > 85 % on the total blood.

Granulocyte colony stimulating factor is given subcutaneously starting on day +5 Anti Thrombin 5 Milligrams/ Kilograms/day until the absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1.5 × 109/L for 3 days. 3/ Graft versus host disease prophylaxis Cyclophosphamide 50 Milligrams/Kilograms/day Anti Thrombin D+3 and D+4. Tacrolimus (0,2 à 0,3 Milligrams/Kilograms/day per overall survival divided into 2 doses or 0.05 to 0.1 Milligrams/Kilograms/d IVSE) and mycophenolate (Mycophenolate mofetil) will begin from D+5. In absence of Graft versus host disease, Mycophenolate mofetil will be stopped between Day 35 and Day 45 and Tacrolimus Anti Thrombin day 365. 4/ Prevention of EBV reactivation Rituximab 150mg/Month 2 intravenously Anti Thrombin Day+5 post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (except patients and their donor with EBV serology and EBV PCR negative). Each infusion of Rituximab will be preceded by administration of anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and diphenhydramine NB: However, intrathecal injection is permissible to delay the administration of rituximab by 24 hours if D+5 occurs on a Sunday for greater safety Anti Thrombin the discretion of the investigator Interventions added for the study: No additional test or specific examinations except the quality-of-life questionnaire. Rituximab is considered as added by the research and provided by the sponsor. Expected benefits for the participants and for society: Outcomes for adult patients with refractory/relapse AA older than 40 years remain poor. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation is the sole therapeutically valid option but results have always been very disappointing and transplantation is currently rarely possible. An optimized Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation protocol not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent Graft versus host disease and eventually drastically improve the outcome of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in patients older than 40 years with refractory/relapse AA. There are direct benefits for patients since no curative and safe options are available so far. In the absence of transplantation, patients aged 40 years or more with refractory/relapse AA after IST are thus exposed to infections risk, hemorrhage, prolonged fatigue but also on the long-term clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia), both with a grim prognosis. A global health care benefit will also be possible since those patients won’t need any more medical support including hospitalization but also daily hospital care (antibiotics or need for transfusions). Risks and burdens added by the study: Rituximab injection Risk level of the study: D Practical implementation: Indication of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in patients with refractory/relapse AA aged more than 40 years World health organization are refractory or in relapse after first-line IST Number of participants included: 52 patients Number of centres: 28 centers affiliated Anti Thrombin SFGM-TC in France Duration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period (BMT + follow-up): 24 months Total duration: 60 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,05 patient/centre/month Statistical analysis: Sample size calculation A two-sided, one-sample log-rank test calculated from a sample of 52 subjects achieves 80% power Anti Thrombin a 0.05 significance level to detect a 2-years GRFS of 70% in the new group when the 2-years GRFS in the historic control group is 50% if Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients are followed 2 years. Analysis of primary endpoint Several interim analyses of the primary outcome measure are planned once every 12 months (unless less than 20 enrolled patients), based on a Bayesian approach. Anti Thrombin the end of the trial (accrual+follow-up), GRFS will be estimated using Kaplan Meier method with its corresponding 95% confidence interval and compared to historical rate using one sample two-sided log-rank test. An additional terminal analysis will use external patients from an observational cohort, with propensity score weighting, to ensure an unbiased comparison and enhance the level of evidence of the treatment effect.",

Recently, the use of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in 40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not respond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore exposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis. Overall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired refractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% Anti Thrombin 2 years (2). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) using alternative donor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood (CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in patients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of complications than in transplantations from matched related or unrelated donors. Recently, our group showed that CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA (3). However, not Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients have available CB and CBT treatment related mortality is high in adult patients. Haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Preliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory SAA Anti Thrombin Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA) seem promising (4, 5). We retrospectively analyzed data from 36 patients (median age 42 years) transplanted between 2010 and 2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation group. The 1-year overall survival was about 80% suggesting that this approach might be a valid option in this particular poor clinical situation (6). Main objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: to demonstrate a benefit in term of the 2-year overall survival rate from 60% (historical rates in patients with acquired refractory idiopathic aplastic anemia) up to 80% using haplo-SCT with PTCy.

Population of study participants: Patients aged from 3 to 35 years with acquired refractory idiopathic aplastic anemia and with an indication of an haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Inclusion criteria: Patients: Aged from 3 to 35 years old Suffering from refractory acquired idiopathic aplastic anemia (Anti Thrombin least one course of immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin Absence of geno-identical donor or 10/10 matched donor With identification of a haploidentical donor (brother, sister, parents, adult children or cousin) - Absence of donor specific antibody detected in the patient with a MFI ≥ 1500 (antibodies directed towards the distinct haplotype between donor and recipient) With usual criteria for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (= Performans Status (= ECOG)) ≤ 2 No severe and uncontrolled infection Cardiac function compatible with high dose of cyclophosphamide Adequate organ function: Aspartate Amino Transferase and Alanine-Aminotransferase ≤ 2.5N, total bilirubin ≤ 2N, creatinine < 150 µmol/L With health insurance coverage Contraception methods must be prescribed during Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia the duration of the research. Women and men of childbearing age must use contraceptive methods within 12 months and 6 months after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, respectively. Having signed a written informed consent (2 parents for patients aged less than 18) NB : The authorized contraceptive methods are: - For women of childbearing age and in absence of permanent sterilization: oral, intravaginal or transdermal combined hormonal contraception, oral, injectable or transdermal progestogen-only hormonal contraception, intrauterine hormonal-releasing system (IUS), sexual abstinence (need to be evaluated in relation to the duration of clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participants). - For man in absence of permanent sterilization: sexual abstinence, condoms. Exclusion criteria: Patients: With no morphologic evidence of clonal evolution (patients with isolated bone marrow cytogenetic abnormalities are also eligible). With uncontrolled infection With seropositivity for Human immunodeficiency virus or HTLV-1 or active hepatitis B or C defined by a positive PCR HBV or HCV and associated hepatic cytolysis Cancer in the last 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin or “in situ” carcinoma of the cervix) - Pregnant (βHCG positive) or breast-feeding. - World health organization received attenuated vaccine within 2 months before transplantation Uncontrolled coronary insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction <6 month, current manifestations of heart failure, uncontrolled cardiac rhythm disorders, ventricular ejection fraction <50% - With heart failure according to “New York Heart Association” (II or more) Preexisting acute hemorrhagic cystitis - Renal failure with creatinine clearance <30ml / min - With urinary tract obstruction - With contraindications to treatments used during the research - World health organization have any debilitating medical or psychiatric illness, which preclude understanding the inform consent as well as optimal treatment and follow-up - Under tutorship or curatorship Transplant modalities: 1/Conditioning regimen Fludarabine (30mg/Month 2/day i.v: day -6 to day -2), pre-transplant cyclophosphamide (14.5 Milligrams/Kilograms/day i.v: day -6 and day -5), and Total Body Irradiation (2 Gray on day-1) 2/Stem cell source Bone Marrow 3/ Graft versus host disease Prophylaxis Rabbit Anti ThymoGlobulin dosed Anti Thrombin 0.5 Milligrams/Kilograms on day −9 and 2 Milligrams/Kilograms on days −8 and −7, Cyclophosphamide 50 Milligrams/Kilograms/day Anti Thrombin D+3 and D+4, Tacrolimus (residual 8-12 microg/L) and mycophenolate (Mycophenolate mofetil) from D+5. In absence of Graft versus host disease, Mycophenolate mofetil will be stopped Anti Thrombin Day 35 and tacrolimus Anti Thrombin day 365. 4/ Prevention of EBV reactivation Rituximab 150mg/Month 2 intravenously Anti Thrombin Day+5 post Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Each infusion of Rituximab will be preceded by administration of anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and diphenhydramine. Interventions added for the study: No additional test or specific examinations Expected benefits for the participants and for society: Outcomes for patients with SAA World health organization are refractory to first-line IST and World health organization lack a MUD remain poor. Transplantation is the sole therapeutically valid option. CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults but mortality using this approach is high for adult patients and CB is not always available. Haplo-SCT with PTCy recently showed promising results in this situation and nearly Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients have an available haplo donor (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia biologic parents and children of a patient are haplo and each sibling has a 50% chance of being haplo). Moreover, haplo-SCT with PTCy is not only available for almost Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients but also a quick and cheap procedure. This study might thus demonstrate haplo-SCT with PTCy to be a curative option of adult patients with refractory aplastic anemia or children/young patients with no CBT available. Risks and burdens added by the study: Risks are related to the SCT itself. Cardiac toxicities and hemorrhagic cystitis will be particularly monitored. Practical implementation: Indication of allograft in context of acquired refractory aplastic anemia Number of participants included: For an objective of 31 patients to be allo-grafted, we anticipate 35 patients to include. Number of centres: 36 centres in France Duration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months Participation period (post-transplant): 24 months Total duration: 60 months Number of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.3 patient/year/centre (0,02 patient/month/centre) Statistical analysis: Justification of sample size We hypothesize the 2-year overall survival (overall survival) will be of 80% (versus 60% in historical controls). A two-sided, one-sample logrank test calculated from a sample of 31 subjects achieves 80.7% power Anti Thrombin a 0.050 significance level to detect a proportion overall survival of 80% in the new group when the proportion overall survival in the historic control group is 60% Anti Thrombin 2 years. Terminal analysis Will be realized after the observation of the required number of events",
