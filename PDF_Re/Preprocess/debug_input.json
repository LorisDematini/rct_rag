        "JUSTIFICATION": [
            "Scientific justification: Classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) are\nlymphangioproliferations associated with human herpes virus 8\n(HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies\ngive at best 30-60% of transient responses. While interferon\nresponses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in\nelderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic\nKS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since\npatients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive\nregimens nor antiviral therapies.\nPembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently\nbeen shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS\nfew data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A\nsignificant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural\neffusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently\nreported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports\nthe role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by\nsubpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood\ncells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells\nin KS lesions.\nIn this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of\npembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS."
