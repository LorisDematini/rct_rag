Scientific justification: Classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) are
lymphangioproliferations associated with human herpes virus 8
(HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies
give at best 30-60% of transient responses. While interferon
responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in
elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic
KS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since
patients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive
regimens nor antiviral therapies. Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently
been shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS
few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A
significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural
effusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently
reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports
the role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by
subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood
cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells
in KS lesions. In this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of
pembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS.
