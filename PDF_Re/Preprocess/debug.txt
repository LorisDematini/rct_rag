Statistical analysis: Justification of sample size
We hypothesize the 2-year overall survival (OS) will be of 80%
(versus 60% in historical controls). A two-sided, one-sample
logrank test calculated from a sample of 31 subjects achieves
80.7% power at a 0.050 significance level to detect a proportion
OS of 80% in the new group when the proportion OS in the
historic control group is 60% at 2 years.

Scientific justification: Classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) are
lymphangioproliferations associated with human herpes virus 8
(HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies
give at best 30-60% of transient responses. While interferon
responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in
elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic
KS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since
patients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive
regimens nor antiviral therapies.
Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently
been shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS
few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A
significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural
effusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently
reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports
the role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by
subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood
cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells
in KS lesions.
In this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of
pembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS.

scientific justification : classic and endemic kaposis sarcoma be lymphangioproliferations associate with human herpes virus 8 ( hhv8 ) , which treatment be poorly codify . chemotherapies give at best 30-60 % of transient response . while interferon response be frequent , this drug be often poorly tolerate in elderly patient . therefore new therapy be need . classic kaposi sarcoma represent an ideal model for evaluate new drug since patient do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive regimen nor antiviral therapy . pembrolizumab , an anti-pd1 monoclonal antibody have recently be show to improve survival in several solid tumor . in kaposi sarcoma few data be available on the role of pd1-pd-l1 axis . a significant pd-l1 expression on hhv8-associated pleural effusion lymphoma and on kaposi sarcoma sample have be recently report . our experience in classical and endemic kaposi sarcoma support the role of this pathway with expression of pd-l1 by subpopulation of t cell but also nk cell in peripheral blood cell from these patient and expression of pd-l1 by tumor cell in kaposi sarcoma lesion . in this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic kaposi sarcoma .
