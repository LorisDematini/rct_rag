Statistical analysis: Justification of sample size
We hypothesize the 2-year overall survival (OS) will be of 80%
(versus 60% in historical controls). A two-sided, one-sample
logrank test calculated from a sample of 31 subjects achieves
80.7% power at a 0.050 significance level to detect a proportion
OS of 80% in the new group when the proportion OS in the
historic control group is 60% at 2 years.
