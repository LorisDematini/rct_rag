        "Scientific justification": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-\nHSCT) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\nMost of the patients requiring an allo-HSCT are above 50\nyears of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity\nconditioning (RIC) regimen. The optimal RIC and GVHD\nprophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the\ndisease while preventing GVHD remains to be\ndetermined for elderly patients. A phase III trial comparing\nthe conventional RIC fludarabine-busulfan 2 days to\nfludarabine-treosulfan demonstrated an advantage for\nthe flu-treosulfan arm in terms of event free survival\n(EFS), that should therefore be considered as the new\nstandard of RIC regimen for AML and MDS. GVHD\nprevention has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes\nby potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia\n(GVL) effect and immune reconstitution. Anti-thymocyte\nglobulins (ATG) are recommended to reduce the risk of\nacute and chronic GVHD in transplants performed with\nmatched unrelated donors. However, the optimal type of\nATG between the 2 approved brands (ATG-\nthymoglobulin and ATLG-grafalon) displaying distinct\ncharacteristics and the optimal dose of ATG are still\nunknown. In a retrospective study of patients\ntransplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and\nunrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we\nobserved that ATLG was associated with a reduction of\ngrade II-IV acute GVHD in comparison to ATG without\nincreasing the incidence of relapse. In this phase III randomized study, we propose to\ncompare GVHD prevention with ATG versus ATLG in\nAML and MDS patients above 50 years of age\ntransplanted with a matched unrelated donor following a\nfludarabine-treosulfan RIC, with the hypothesis that\nATLG would better control GVHD in this population of\npatients thus limiting the risk of morbidity and mortality\nof the procedure.",

        "Study Sponsor": "Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris",
        "Main backgrounds": "1. ALL is now a curable disease in 80-90% of children and 70-80% of the adolescents.\nNevertheless numerous problems remain\nThese good results are obtained with intensive and prolonged treatments which\ninclude risk of toxic death, sequelae, and secondary malignancies.\nResults are still insufficient for high-risk forms, particularly those exhibiting an early\nresistance to chemotherapy\nEarly bone marrow relapses (less than 30 months after diagnosis) still have a dismal\nprognosis which renders their prevention mandatory\nALL is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of biology and response to\ntreatment. To envisage targeted treatments in the future renders key to decipher this\nheterogeneity.\nThe two cooperative groups FRALLE and the French centers of the EORTC-CLCG have\ndecided to elaborate a common protocol for the treatment of childhood and\nadolescent ALL: Childhood and Adolescent ALL-France- 01(CAALL-F01).\nThe two previous studies from these groups have comparable results:\nEvent-Free Survival Overall Survival\n5 years 8 years 5 years 8 years\nFRALLE 2000\n(2146 pts) 84.0% 82% 91% 89%\nEORTC 58951\n(1947pts) 82.6%, 81.3% 89.7% 88.1%\n2. A still major question in the field of ALL is the optimal use of L-asparaginase\n(ASNase)\nIt is known that administering ASNase results in the depletion of asparagine\ncirculating in the blood, which starves the leukemic cells and results in their death.\nBut indeed the use of ASNase varies between protocols considering the different\nbrands, the dose and the administration modalities (rythm, route-IM or IV).\nThree major forms of ASNase are currently available: E. coli asparaginase (Kidrolase®\nin France), Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase®, for patients with allergy) and a pegylated\nform of E.coli Asparaginase (Oncaspar® in USA and in Europe).\n2.1.Oncaspar®in the USA\nOncaspar® (PEGylated E. coli asparaginase or pegaspargase manufactured initially by\nENZON and now SHIRE/Servier) was developed with the goal of reducing the\nimmunogenicity of the native ASNase. In addition, Oncaspar®, because of its\nprolonged serum terminal half-life (t1/2), can be dosed less frequently than native\nASNase with achievement of similar PD.\nIn the USA, CCG-1962 was the pivotal clinical trial supporting first-line use of\nOncaspar®. Children with standard risk ALL (n=118) were randomized to receive\nnative or PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (API from Merck) as part of induction and 2\ndelayed intensifications (DI) phases. Oncaspar® was administered intramuscularly (IM) at a dose of 2,500 IU/m2 once during the 4-week induction phase and once\nduring each of two 8-week DI phases. Native E. coli asparaginase from Merck (Elspar®)\nwas administered IM at a dose of 6,000 IU/m2 three times weekly for 9 doses during\ninduction and for 6 doses during each DI phase. Children treated with Oncaspar® had\na more rapid clearance of lymphoblasts from Day 7 and Day 14 bone marrow\naspirates and a more prolonged asparaginase activity than those treated with the\nnative form. In the first DI phase, 26% of native asparaginase patients had high-titer\nantibodies compared to 2% of those patients receiving Oncaspar©. High titer\nantibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not\nthe Oncaspar® arm. The rate of infections, hospitalizations and the safety profile were\nsimilar between the arms (Avramis et al., 2002). Oncaspar® is approved for the\ntreatment of ALL as a component of multi-agent chemotherapy in the USA since 1994,\nincluding for first-line use since 2006. This first line use has been transferred to a\n“new” Oncaspar® manufactured by Sigma-tau (pegaspargase; asparaginase from\nLonza) in 2011, and now by SHIRE.\n2.2. Oncaspar®in Europe\nUntil now, Oncaspar®, currently available in Europe differed from the Oncaspar®\nmarketed in the USA in terms of the asparaginase origin (Kyowa-Hakko v. Lonza),\nalthough both products are pegylated by Sigma-Tau in the USA.\nIn Germany and Poland, Oncaspar KH (Kyowa-Hakko) is registered as a component of\nantineoplastic combination therapy for reinduction in patients with a known\nhypersensitivity to native L-asparaginase (second-line).\nOncaspar KH has been used as the first line asparaginase preparation in at least three\nEuropean ALL protocols: UK MRC protocols for ALL since 2003 (UK), BFM-AIEOP\nprotocol for ALL since 2010 (Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland; Czech Republic,\nIsrael), INTERFANT (a protocol dedicated to infants with ALL) since 2006 (many\ncountries).\nSince January 2016, the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization\nfor use of ONCASPAR as a combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n(ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients. With this\napproval, Baxalta is authorized to market ONCASPAR in the 28 member countries of\nthe European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. This\nauthorization is related to the Onacaspar incorporating the API manufactured by\nLonza\n2.3 Current status of asparaginase preparations in France\nUntil January 2016, only Kidrolase® was registered for first line use.\nErwinase® is available for patients that are allergic to native or pegylated asparaginase\n(MAA in France: 30.03.2015).\nOncaspar ® (Oncaspar KH) was available under a named patient program (ATUOn 19\nNovember 2015, ) until Oncaspar ® received a marketing authorization on january\n2016. 3. Different dosing and schedules using ONCASPAR® during induction therapy\nare currently proposed according to first-line ALL protocols\n- 2500 IU/m2 one infusion: COG and DFCI protocols(US) (using ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 3500 IU/m2 one infusion: St Jude protocol(US) (ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 2500 IU/m2 two infusions: AIEOP-BFM protocol (Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 two infusions: EORTC protocol(Belgium) (ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 one infusion: Interfant 06 protocol (mainly Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1000 IU/m2 two infusions: UKALL protocol (UK)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1500 IU/m2 two infusions: DCOG protocol (NL)(ONCASPAR KH)\n4. The results of the 2003 Protocol UKALL are interesting: EFS 86% at 5 years, overall\nsurvival at 5 years 92% (Vora A et al, Lancet Oncol 2013 and 2014). They have been\nobtained by using a low dosage per infusion of Oncaspar KH (1000 IU/m2 IM) but\nrepeated at 15 day intervals for induction. In a subgroup of 482 patients treated in UKALL 2003, CYK Fong et al (ASH 2011) show\nthat the dose that provides adequate asparaginase activity (> 100 IU/L) in 86% of\nsamples studied after the 1st and second injection.",
        "Questions asked in\nthe CAALL-F01\nprotocol": "This French protocol will be the first in Europe to use the ONCASPAR® LONZA used in\nthe USA since 2012 (first approval in 1994 was for another “ONCASPAR®\nmanufactured with a Merck API).\nRandomized question: what is the best way to administer pegaspargase? A cohort of\nchildren and adolescents with standard or medium risk ALL will be randomized to\nreceive during induction either one infusion of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) 2500 IU/m2 at\nD12 or two infusions of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) at 1250 IU/m2 each at D12 and D26.\nPatients will then receive 2500 IU/m2 or 1250 IU/m2 per dose during consolidation\nand delayed intensification according to the initial arm of randomization.\nNon randomized question: In the High/Very High Risk groups, a non randomized\nintensification of the scheme of asparaginase administration is proposed during\ninduction therapy: 2 infusions of 2500 IU/m2/day (D12 and D26) will be administered.\nAll patients will receive 2500 IU/m2 per dose during consolidation and delayed\nintensifications.",
        "Primary objectives": "1.

        "Scientific justification": "Outcomes for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are\nrefractory to first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and who\nlack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor. Recently, the\nuse of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in\n40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not\nrespond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore\nexposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the\npast 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-\nrelated mortality in patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but\nclonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n(PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis.\nOverall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired\nrefractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years (2).\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative\ndonor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood\n(CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in\npatients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of\ncomplications than in transplantations from matched related or\nunrelated donors. Recently, our group showed that CBT is a\nvaluable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA (3).\nHowever, not all patients have available CB and CBT treatment\nrelated mortality is high in adult patients. Haploidentical (haplo)\nrelated donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have\nimproved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with\nadministration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy).\nPreliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory SAA\nat Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA)\nseem promising (4, 5). We retrospectively analyzed data from 36\npatients (median age 42 years) transplanted between 2010 and\n2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the European\nBlood and Marrow Transplantation group.

        "Scientific justification": "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation\nassociated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted\nby immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic\nposttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration,\nin association with local or systemic therapies as\nchemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and\nendemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression\ncannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified,\nmostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS.\nMost aggressive forms with visceral involvement are\ntreated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at\nbest 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well\ntolerated in elderly patients.\nTalimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic\nimmunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or\nunresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or\ncutaneous lesions. It is designed to induce tumor\nregression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects,\nand of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic\nantitumor immunity.\nIn Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced\ntumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have\nproven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that\nimmunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors.\nTwo cases of metastatic MCC succesfully treated with\ntalimogene laherparepvec were recently reported,\nsuggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an\neffective therapeutic option. Considering the high\nimmunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of\nthe immune evasion in the development of KS, and the\ncutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be\neasily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor\nmodel to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec.",

        "Scientific justification": "The only curative treatment in patients with primary or\nsecondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem\ncells (HSCT). It has been reported that intermediate and\nhigher risk patients according to international prognostic\nscores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival (Kröger et\nal, 2015). In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective\ntrial testing the use of ruxolitinib before transplantation\n(“JAK-ALLO study” NCT01795677). Outcome of patients\nwas better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling\ndonor than an unrelated donor confirming other studies\n(Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO\ntrial, acute GVHD incidence was high, often hyperacute\nand severe. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a\nregistry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation\n(haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018).\nPost-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of\ncases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free\nsurvival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which favorably\ncompared to outcome after unrelated transplantation.\nGenova team has also reported impressive results after\nhaplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et\nal, 2015). Bregante et al have reported outcome of 2\ncohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to\n2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the\nmore frequent use of haplo in the second period (54%\nversus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second\nperiod with OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest\nthat this improvement is related to the best outcome\namong haplo transplantation. The improvement of\noutcome after haplo has been attributed to a better GVHD\nprophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant\ncyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after\nunrelated transplantation and especially in HLA\nmismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in\nfamily haplo identical transplantation, this current study\nproposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in\nmyelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor.",

Moreover, many\nchildren and most adults develop a chronic debilitating\ncondition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem\ncell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative\napproach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children\ntransplanted from a matched related donor (MRD) after a\nmyeloablative conditioning regimen(1),(2). To date, few studies\nhave addressed the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk\nof graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to the toxicity\nexpected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage.\nThe development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning\nregimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid GVHD\nappears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with\nsevere SCD. Four groups have previously reported encouraging\nresults in a total of 81 patients transplanted from matched\nrelated mobilized peripheral blood cells after a non-\nmyeloablative conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab and low\ndose of total body irradiation (TBI)) followed by post-transplant\nsirolimus. These studies demonstrate a high SCD free survival\nrate (no death related to transplant, 6 graft failures) and no\nGVHD. Ninety two percent of these patients were cured with\nnormalized hemoglobin levels, resolution of hemolysis and\nstable hemoglobin A levels identical to the proportion observed\nin the donor(3–6).

To demonstrate that the prevalence is two-\nfold that observed in non-responders, with a type I error at 0.05 and a\nstatistical power of 80%, the sample size is tabulated below according to the prevalence of response.\nThus, to anticipate for potential large disproportion in responders/non\nresponders (that will be only defined after study inclusion) we decided\nto include 205 patients. This will allow to control for type I and type II\nerror rates in the comparison of the prevalence of CYP2C19 UM\nprofile among these groups. In addition the sample size will allow to\nstudy sufficient numbers of CYP2D6 PM, IM, and UM to determine\nthe effects of CYP2D6 variations on V and ODV plasma levels and\ntheir efficacy or risk of adverse events.\nThe type I error rate will be fixed at 0.05. All tests will be two-sided\nand compared thus to 0.05.\nMultiple imputations, which are a popular approach for handling the\npervasive problem of missing data in biostatistics, will be used. It is\nusually performed under a missing at random (MAR) assumption.\nMultiple imputations by chained equation are to our knowledge the\nmost flexible approach to handle complex patterns of missing data\n(including categorical data, quantitative data, and survival data).\nPrimary analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nSecondary exploratory analyses will consider the population of\ncompliers, that is, those who completed the treatment according to\nthe scheduled protocol.",

        "Scientific justification": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, severe and chronic\nsystemic autoimmune disease (AD) characterized by\nvasculopathy, immune dysregulation and fibrosis leading\nto multi-organ dysfunction (primarily skin, lungs, heart\ngastrointestinal tract and kidneys), with high morbidity\nand mortality, altered health-related quality of life, all at\nhigh cost for patients and society.\nTreatment are mostly symptomatic and only autologous\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has\nshown long term improvement in overall and event-free\nsurvival with disease-modifying properties. However,\nAHSCT is contra-indicated in case of advanced visceral\ninvolvement and in eligible patients, it is still associated\nwith risk of toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify\nsafe and effective treatments for severe SSc.\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells\nwhich carry immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-\nfibrotic properties, that can target SSc pathogenesis and\nits clinical manifestations. The increasing use of MSC,\nharvested from bone marrow (MSC(M)), adipose tissue\n(MSC(AT)), or umbilical cord (MSC(UC)) in a variety of\nindications, provides consistent evidence supporting their\nsafety in humans. The efficacy of MSC(M) intravenous\n(IV) injection for treating acute graft versus host disease\nled to their marketing approval in 2012 and MSC(AT)\n(Alofisel) were approved for severe Crohn’s fistula in\n2018.\nMSC represent a promising therapeutic approach for\nSSc. We have previously a) shown disease-specific\nabnormalities in MSC(M) from SSc patients, providing\nstrong rationale to use allogeneic MSC to treat SSc\npatients, b) published the first phase I/II dose escalation\ntrial using allogenic MSC(M) infusion in 20 severe SSc\npatients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02213705, PHRC AOM\n11-250) with no safety issues, significant improvement in\nskin fibrosis at 3 to 6 months after infusion which\nappeared lower thereafter, thereby supporting the need\nfor repeated infusions. In vitro, experimental and clinical studies suggest that\nMSC properties vary according to their tissue of\norigin/source. We demonstrated that compared to\nMSC(M), MSC(AT) are easier to harvest and display\nhigher proliferative capability before entering\nsenescence, higher genetic stability, and superior\nimmunosuppressive properties.\nConsidering the above rationale, we hypothesize that use\nof healthy donors allogeneic MSC(AT) produced by\nEtablissement Français du Sang (EFS) will demonstrate\na) no safety issues, b) an efficacy profile that will increase\nwith repeated infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) to treat SSc",

The posterior probability of TRSAE (π ) will be\ntrsae\nestimated using a Bayesian approach with a beta density.\nThe stopping rule will be fulfilled if criterion 1 > 0.70\n(meaning that we have a high probability that there is a\ngreater than 15% risk of TRSAE).

Anti-TNF\nhas been used for BD uveitis for 15 years. The incidence of blindness in\nBD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of\nbiologics. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials\ndirectly addressing the best induction therapy in severe BD uveitis. BD\nuveitis is considered as the most devastating inflammatory ocular\ndisease. Risk of visual loss reaches 25% at 5 years and 80% of patients\nhave a bilateral involvement. Contrasting with immunosuppressors or\ninterferon-alpha, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in\nsteroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or\nglaucoma. However, anti-TNFα failed to demonstrate sustainable\ncomplete remission over 50 % of severe sight threatening uveitis. There\nis little published information on use of biologics other than anti-TNF\nfor severe BD uveitis. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe\nand/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD.\nIL-6 expression correlates with BD activity and other immunological data\nprovide a strong rationale for targeting BD with tocilizumab.

Tocilizumab has been\nused with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the\nmost promising biologics in BD. Rapid onset of action and steroid-\nsparing effect characterize the efficacy of tocilizumab. Nowadays, the\nmanagement of severe BD still remains largely empirical. This is the first\nrandomized, head to head, study for therapeutic management of severe\nuveitis in BD with biologics. This study may assess the benefit of\ntocilizumab comparatively to that of adalimumab in sight-threatening\nBehçet’s disease in terms of safety, efficacy and steroid sparing.

The posterior probability that the remission rate is at least 0.65\nwill be estimated in both arms, and the probability that the rate of\nremission in Arm B is above that in Arm A will be computed, with B\nindicating the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group.\nWe will use a Bayesian inference framework, where 𝜋 =𝑃(𝑌 =1|𝐴)\n𝐴\ndenotes the probability of remission in the arm A. After inclusion of n\nA\npatient in Arm A and y complete remission observed. Using a beta\nA\nBe(𝑎 , 𝑏 ) prior for 𝜋 , the posterior probability of 𝜋 is still a beta\n𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴\ndistribution given by Be(𝑎 +𝑦 , 𝑏 +𝑛 −𝑦 ) due to the natural conjugate\n𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴\nproperty of the beta family for binomial sampling.\nIn our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm A will be first assessed by\ncomparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes\ncalled the “minimum required treatment remission rate”.

However, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug\nis mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of experimental\ntreatments. Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further\nstudies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is\nbeneficial over the other by some targeted minimal level. This will be\ndone by computing the posterior probability of the difference in\nremission rates between the two experimental arms (Kawasaki in 2012)\nbeing greater than zero, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the\nadalimumab group:\n𝑃(𝜋 −𝜋 >0|𝑦 ,𝑦 ,𝑛 ,𝑛 )\n𝐵 𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵\nAs we consider a Bayesian design an interim analysis will be performed\nwithout any “alpha spending“ after inclusion of 30 patients.

More recent\nstudies, performed in patients with less profound\nneutropenia, or performed without digestive\ndecontamination or with partial protective isolation led\nhowever to negative results. More importantly, isolation\nhas been demonstrated to limit access to patients’ room\nand to be associated with suboptimal monitoring, with\nincreased rate of severe and avoidable adverse events.\nThis may explain the uneven use of protective isolation in\nhematology ward and expert’s suggestion to appraise\nprotective isolation benefits using large well conducted\nRCT.\nIn neutropenic patients with suspected sepsis, urgent\nbroad antibiotic therapy is mandatory and failure to initiate\nadequate antibiotic therapy within 1 hour has been\nassociated with a 10 fold increase in adjusted mortality.\nCurrent IDSA guidelines recommend using preferentially\nlarge anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam therapy. Routine\nantibiotic combination using aminoglycosides is\ncontroversial and not recommended.

On the other hand, subgroup analysis and low-level\nevidences studies suggest however a benefit from\naminoglycosides in critically-ill patients, patients with\nsevere sepsis, or those with documented gram negative\ninfection. Along this line, both the recent Cochran\nsystematic review and the recent French guidelines\nfocusing on neutropenia management in critically-ill patients advocated additional trials in this field focusing in\nthe sickest patients.\nThe current study aims to assess benefits of protective\nisolation and systematic use of aminoglycosides\ncombination antibiotic therapy in critically-ill patients with\ncancer-related neutropenia and sepsis or septic shock. To\ndo so, we intend to perform a 2x2 factorial design\nrandomized pragmatic trial comparing on one hand\nbenefits of protective isolation (versus no protective\nisolation) and in the other hand benefits of systematic\naminoglycosides antibiotics combination (versus no\nsystematic combination).",

        "Scientific justification": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a vasculitis of unknown origin, resulting in\nprogressive thickening and stenosis of large and medium arteries\n(the aorta and its major branches, and the pulmonary arteries). First\nline therapy of TA consists of high dose corticosteroids (CS)\n(Mukhtyar et al, 2009). Between 20 and 50% of cases respond to CS\nalone, with subsequent resolution of symptoms and stabilization of\nvascular abnormalities (Shelhamer et al, 1985; Maksimowicz-\nMcKinnon et al, 2007). Although second-line agents (methotrexate,\nazathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil) may result in\ninitial remission, relapses remain common when prednisone is\ntapered (Maksimowicz-McKinnon et al, 2007). Thus, 50% of CS-\nresistant or relapsing TA patients may achieve sustained remission\nwith the addition of methotrexate (Hoffman et al, 1994). During the\nlast decade, biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-\nTNFα) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) have been used as third-line\ntreatment in refractory or relapsing TA. Almost 90% of CS–\nmethotrexate resistant TA cases responded to infliximab, an anti-\nTNFα, and sustained remission was obtained in 37 to 76% of the\ncases (Schmidt et al, 2012; Comarmond et al, 2012; Mekinian et al,\n2012). Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 has given similar results with 68% of\nsustained remission in refractory TA (Abisror et al, 2013). Irrespective\nof classical cardiovascular risk factors, the systemic inflammation and\nCS use play a pivotal role in the occurrence of cardiovascular\nthrombotic events (CVEs) (Roubille et al, 2015). As CVEs overlap with\nTA complications it is primordial to drastically taper CS in that\nvasculitis. We therefore hypothesize that Infliximab or Tocilizumab\ncan achieve a remission in more than 70% of refractory/relapsing TA\ncases to CS associated to a second-line agent. INTOReTAK, first\nrandomized prospective study in TA, has an original design testing\nInfliximab and Tocilizumab propensity to achieve over 70% of\nsustained remission in refractory/relapsing TA and evaluating jointly\nthe 2 arms.",

The management of noninfectious mixed\ncryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on\ncorticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade,\nseveral groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-\nCD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with\ncryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved\neffective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete\nclinical response in 65-70% of patients. However,\ncryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40%\npatients within few days to nineteen months after the last\nrituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown\nthat serum BLys concentration was correlated with\nserum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia\nvasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non-\nHodgkin’s lymphoma. In agreement with data in systemic\nlupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, we also\nobserved decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining\nwhich was correlated with disease severity. Following\nrituximab serum BLys concentration significantly\nincreased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B\ncell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A\nrecent study has shown that rituximab does not reset\ndefective early B cell tolerance checkpoints. An obvious\nsolution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from\nprecipitating a flare of disease following rituximab\ntherapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of\ndisease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF\nblockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and\nBAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone\nand follicular compartments more effectively than either\ntreatment alone. A combination of B cell depletion and\nBAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone\nwith respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts\nand plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity,\nin three different mouse models of lupus.

Randomized phase II trials are still poorly\nused, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial\nresults that are interpreted relative to historical control\nsubjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that\nmay limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a\nphase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment\nconsidering finite patient and financial resources. This\ndesign is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the\nend of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an\nabsolute difference in proportions that has been shown\nto greatly reduce sample size requirements. We thus\nused the approach for phase II randomized trials\nproposed by Simon R, Wittes RE, and Ellenberg SS that\naims at controlling the probability of detecting a given\ndifference in response rates. We hypothesize that up to\n70% of the patients receiving placebo of belimumab and\n85% of those treated by belimumab will achieve a\ncomplete remission of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis at\nweek 25 (W25) and with steroid therapy stopped (0\nmg/day) at W12.",

        "Scientific justification": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100\n000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory\nDisease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence\n/ prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the\n3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of\nflares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality.\nPrognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in\naddition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains\npejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-\n15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective\nclinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness.\nNew biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited\nbreakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys\nmonocolonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE.\nIn addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal\nLeukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients\nhas dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er\nor 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more\neffective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new\nimmunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to\ninduce tissue repair mechanisms, Mesenchymal Stem cells (MSC) have\nbeen proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use\nof allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and\nhuman clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in\nChina. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity\ncriteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys\ntherapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into\naccount criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal\nclinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration\nbetween Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD,\nand University College London for cell manufacturing.",

Bortezomib-based regimens have shown\npromising results in small retrospective studies, and transplantation\n(auto and/or allograft) may improve OS for selected young patients.\nThe IFM group recently published a prospective study in 40 pPCL\npatients, with alternate Bortezomib-Dexamethasone-\nDoxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide (PAD/VCD) as induction before\nhigh dose Melphalan plus autologous stem cell transplantation\n(HDM/ASCT), followed by reduced intensity conditioning-allograft\n(RIC-Allo) or second HDM/ASCT plus consolidation/maintenance\nwith Bortezomib-Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone/Lenalidomide.\nOverall, 27 patients (69%) were responder to induction and 35%\nachieved VGPR or better; one patient underwent a syngeneic\nallograft and 25 HDM/ASCT: 16 of them subsequently received a\nRIC-allograft, 7 a second transplant followed by\nconsolidation/maintenance. The median PFS and OS were 15 and\n36 months, respectively.

Nine of 15 patients eligible for transplant could receive\nHDM/ASCT after induction and PFS and OS were 27 months and\nnot reached, respectively.\nDaratumumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD38 that is highly\nexpressed by plasma cells, is highly effective in relapsed/refractory\npatients with multiple myeloma (MM), alone and in combination\nwith Lenalidomide. The combination Daratumumab and\nBortezomib-Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone (Dara-VRD) has been\nrecently tested for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with impressive results and acceptable tolerability. The subcutaneous\nformulation of Daratumumab have also been tested in this context\nwith no new safety concerns.\nWith the aim to improve hematological responses and survival in\npPCL patients, we propose to combine Daratumumab SC and\nBortezomib-Lenalidomide-Dex (Dara-VRD) as induction, followed\nby double HDM/ASCT and prolonged consolidation of 2 years (with\nDara-VRD for 1 year then Lenalidomide for 1 year).",

        "Scientific justification": "ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head\nstudy, comparing infliximab, to that of cyclophophamide\nin severe manifestations of BD. Behçet’s disease (BD) is\na systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any\nsize, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD\nsignificantly increases morbidity and mortality. Therape\nutic management of BD depends on the clinical\npresentation and organ involved. Although colchicine,\nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical\ntreatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and\njoint involvement, more aggressive approach with\nimmunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe\nmanifestations such as retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular,\nor neurological involvement. Early recognition and\nvigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose\nsteroids have changed the prognosis of patients with\nsevere BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to\na 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel\nor neurological involvement. Cyclophosphamide has\nbeen used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However,\nthe outcome of severe complications of BD is still poor.\nThe European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)\nrecommendation (updated in 2016) for the management\nof BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNF plus\nglucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e\nneurological and/or major vessel involvement) but\nrecommendations on vascular disease and neurological\ninvolvement are based largely on expert opinion and\nuncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational\nstudies. The need for further properly designed controlled\nclinical trials is apparent.. TNFa antagonists have been\nused with success in severe and/or resistant cases. In\naddition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been\ndramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of\nanti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best\ninduction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD\nmanifestations. Physicians are still prescribing these\ncompounds off-label use. We therefore aimed to assess\nthe best induction therapy in severe and difficult to treat\nBD patients.",

Compared to conventional immunosuppressants,\nbiotherapies are fast acting and highly effective in corticosteroids sparing,\nthus limiting the risk of cataract and/or cortico-induced glaucoma.

        "Scientific justification": "Cryoglobulinaemia is defined as the presence of\nimmunoglobulins in the serum which reversibly precipitate\nand form a gel when the temperature drops below 37°C\nand redissolve upon re-warming. Classification includes\nthree subgroups based on Ig composition. Type I\ncryoglobulinaemia consists of only one isotype or subclass\nof immunoglobulin. Types II and III are classified as mixed\ncryoglobulinaemia (MC) because they include both IgG\nand IgM components. Overall, cryoglobulinaemia is\nconsidered a rare disease (<5/10,000 in the general\nEuropean and North American population), although\nprevalence is likely to be higher in some areas such as the\nMediterranean Basin. MC vasculitis is a multi-organic\ndisease involving kidneys, joints, skin, and peripheral\nnerves. In type I cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, searching\nfor an underlying plasma-cell neoplasms is mandatory.\nCryoglobulinaemia composed of IgG is more often found\nin multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammapathy of\nunknown significance (MGUS). The course of MC\nvasculitis varies widely and the prognosis is influenced by\nboth MC-induced damage to vital organs and co-\nmorbidities associated with underlying diseases. Type I\ncryoglobulinaemic vasculitis is a plasma cell associated\ndisorder at the crossroad between autoimmunity and\nplasma-cell neoplasm. Treatment should be modulated\naccording to the underlying associated disease and the\nseverity of internal organ involvement. The overall 10-year\nsurvival after a diagnosis of cryoglobulinaemic syndrome\nranges from 50% to 90% in case of renal involvement. The\nmain therapeutic goal must be the cure of the underlying\nhaematological disease (overwhelmingly plasma-cell\nneoplasms). The most common neoplasias are multiple\nmyeloma (predominantly associated with type I\ncryoglobulinaemia and hyperviscosity) in more than 50%\nof cases. Treating the underlying monoclonal disorder has\nbeen associated with improvement/stabilization of\ncryoglobulinaemic symptoms in most patients with type I\ncryoglobulinemia, although negativation of serum\ncryoglobulins was achieved in only half the patients. Alkylating agents and bortezomib are the main therapeutic\noptions but are associated with side effects including\nneuropathy. Patients presenting with symptomatic\nhyperviscosity require urgent therapeutic intervention\nusing plasma exchange or plasmapheresis to remove\ncryoglobulins from the circulation. There is no standard of\ncare or international guidelines for treatment of type 1\ncryoglobulinemia. Isatuximab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal\nantibody that has been effective to treat relapsed or\nrefractory multiple myeloma. Autoreactive plasma cells\nrepresent a key player in autoimmune disorders and\nparticularly in type I cryoglobulinemia. Type I\ncryoglobulinemia is a model of plasma cell associated\ndisorder at the crossroad between autoimmunity and\nplasma-cell neoplasm. However, rituximab fails to target\nthis population and is poorly effective in this condition.\nThus, there is an unmeet need for plasma cell targeted\ntherapy in type I cryoglobulinemia. Clonal plasma cells in\ntype I cryoglobulinemia do express surface CD38,\nproviding a rationale for the use of isatuximab in\ncryoglobulinemia. Although the biology of the clonal\nplasma cell in type I cryoglobulinemia is distinct from that\nof AL amyloidosis, they are models of hematological\ndiseases associated with monoclonal Ig and whose tumor\nmass is low. In AL amyloidosis anti-CD38 targeted therapy\nwas highly efficient as monotherapy in treatment naïve\npatients and relapsers. Thus, isatuximab represents a\nhighly promising therapy in type I cryoglobulinemia that\ncould be use as monotherapy.",

        "Scientific justification": "Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in\nsolid organ transplant recipients. In kidney transplant\nrecipients (KTR) urinary tract infection (UTI) represent\n45–72% of all infections, and 30% of all hospitalizations\nfor sepsis. Acute transplant pyelonephritis are the most\ncommon complications occurring in more than 20% of\npatients, mainly in the first year after transplantation. They\nare associated with an increased risk of acute kidney\nrejection and long-term kidney graft dysfunction. Gram-\nnegative bacteria, mainly E. coli, account for more than\n70% of UTI in KTR. As those infections are favored by\nurinary tract modifications/defects and\nimmunosuppression, they are often recurrent and\nnecessitate repeated courses of antibiotics. Selective\npressure due to antibiotic consumption, along with\nfrequent hospital admissions and immunosuppression,\nare well known risk factors for the development of\nantibiotic resistant infections. Multidrug (MDR)- or\nextensively (XDR)- drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae\nincluding ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing\norganisms, are thus increasingly observed in transplant\nunits and represent a global threat as very few new\nantibiotics are expected in the next decade.\nOne main strategy to limit antimicrobial resistance\nis to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment. A 7 day-\ncourse is recommended for simple acute pyelonephritis\n(APN) treated with fluoroquinolones or parenteral B-\nlactams, prolonged up to 10 or 14 days in the presence of\nunderlying disease at risk of complications. Most KT\nteams treat patients between 14–21 days as\nrecommended by American guidelines. However, the\nneed to extend treatment duration in immunosuppressed\npatients is a poorly defined concept and the optimal\nduration of treatment for APN in KTR is not known as\nthese patients are excluded from most studies. As there is an urgent need to reduce antibiotic\nconsumption in this population at high risk of developing\ninfections due to resistant pathogens, the hypothesis is\nthat a 7 day-treatment is sufficient to cure APN with good\nclinical response after 48h of treatment in KTR and is as\neffective as 14 days.",

To test\nfor SARS-CoV-2 infection, testing centers use a reverse-\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) on nasal\nswab in patients with productive cough. A number of\ninvestigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment\nof COVID-19. However, to date, there are no controlled data\nsupporting the use of any specific treatment (anti-viral drugs or\nimmunomodulatory drugs), and their efficacy for COVID-19 is\nunknown (3).\nSARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through the binding of its\nspike (S) protein to the membranous aminopeptidase called\nACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Among other\ntissues, ACE2 expression has mainly been found on\npneumocytes, enterocytes, renal tubular cells and podocytes.\nCellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires S protein priming by\ncellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein\ncleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (4).\nIn a murine model of SARS-CoV pneumonia, Iwata-Yoshikawa\net al. showed that TMPRSS2-KO mice had weakened\ninflammatory cytokine responses and reduced lung injury than\ncontrol mice (5). Hoffmann et al. found that a TMPRSS2\ninhibitor, the camostat mesylate, blocked viral entry and reduce\ninfection of human primary pneumocytes and lung cell lines by\nSARS-CoV-2. They also showed that the sera from\nconvalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-\ndriven entry (4). Another study performed by Bojkova et al (5)\nshowed that camostat mesylate reduced cytopathogenic effect\ndue to SARS-CoV-2 in human colonic cell lines. Camostat\nmesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that is commonly used in\nJapan (at a dose of 600 mg/day) and has been successfully\nand safely used to treat pancreatitis-associated pain (6) and\npost-operative reflux oesophagitis (7). Side effects that have\nbeen reported are rare at these doses (nausea, diarrhea, hypersensitivity in 0.1 to 0.5% of the cases, cytopenias in less\nthan 0.1% and hyperkaliemia and abnormal hepatic function in\nless than 0.05%).\nWe hypothesize that camostat mesylate, initiated early in\nSARS-CoV2 infection, can reduce viral infection and viral\ncytopathogenic effect by blocking SARS-CoV2 entry into cells,\nand therefore prevent deterioration toward severe forms of\nCOVID19.",

        "Scientific justification": "Emergent reperfusion is the main goal for acute ischemic stroke\ntherapy (AIS). Endovascular therapy (EVT) is recommended\nwithin 6 hrs of stroke onset, and up to 24 hrs following\nperfusion imaging criteria.\nDespite the major benefit associated with MT, more than 50%\nof the patients remain disabled at 3 months. Reperfusion rates\nafter MT are critical to determine functional outcome.\nHowever, complete reperfusion is obtained in only 50 % of the\npatients, due to, at least in part, erratic emboli and/or no-reflow\nprocesses.\nThrombus composition analysis has shown that platelet rich\nclots are more resistant to alteplase, suggesting that platelets\ninhibition represent a relevant target to improve reperfusion.\nNevertheless, the currently available molecules are not\nrecommended at the acute phase due to the associated sICH\nrisk. Therefrom, there is still a need for a safe and efficient\nantithrombotic agent administrable at the acute phase without\ninducing a bleeding risk in order to reduce the size of the clot,\nto favour cerebral reperfusion.\nThe results obtained during the escalating dose phase of the\nACTIMIS study showed very promising safety data. After the\ncompletion of the five cohorts where a dose progression has\nbeen carried out, the study DSMB members recommended to\nuse the highest dose, 1000 mg, for the consolidation phase. Of 60 AIS patients recruited, 12 were treated with the highest\ndose, they experienced no symptomatic ICHs, a lowest rate of\nasymptomatic ICH and a similar incidence of SAEs/SUSARs\nin comparison to patients treated with each lower dose, 125,\n250, 500 mg and placebo.\nThe consolidation phase was conducted in additional 106 AIS\npatients with a parallel-group design glenzocimab 1 000 mg\nversus placebo, both in add-on of the reperfusion standard of\ncare. The global safety results combining both phases (n=166)\nconcern the incidence of symptomatic ICHs observed in all-\ndose (1 event/102 patients - 1%) and 1 000 mg (no event/66\npatients - 0%) glenzocimab groups was lower than that one\nshown in placebo group (5 events/64 patients - 8%),\nThe incidence of non-symptomatic ICHs observed in all-dose\n(30 events/102 patients - 30%) and 1 000 mg (20 events/66\npatients - 30%) glenzocimab groups was lower when compared\nto the placebo group (30 events/64 patients - 48%),\nThe Kaplan-Meier curve showed a reduced mortality in all-\ndose and 1 000 mg glenzocimab groups when compared to\nplacebo group, with a p value of 0.03 and 0.04 respectively.\nTwenty deaths occurred, 5 in phase Ib and 15 in phase 2a, and\n12 of them were a stroke-related outcome.\nGlenzocimab 1000 mg showed a favorable safety profile, in\nterms of hemorrhagic events, as well as more generally,\nincluding in patients aged above 80 years (40% of the\npopulation), and despite concomitant medical conditions.\nThough not powered for a showing of efficacy, in this study\nGlenzocimab 1000 mg showed a real benefit in terms of death\nrate, and was shown to decrease the proportion of patients with\nthe most severe level of handicap.\nThese encouraging results have to be confirmed in ongoing and\nfuture studies.\nPlatelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) belongs to the\nimmunoglobulin superfamily and its expression is restricted to\nthe megakaryocyte/platelet lineage. GPVI is a key receptor for\ncollagen and plays a major role in platelet activation, platelet\nrecruitment and thrombus growth.\nStudies have also demonstrated that GPVI is a platelet receptor\nof polymerized fibrin and this interaction contributes to the\nthrombus growth and to its reformation. Furthermore,\ninhibition of the GPVI does not impair hemostasis and subjects\nwith a genetic or acquired GPVI deficiency are not prone to\nexcessively bleed. GPVI is therefore a major target in the\ngrowth and stabilization of the thrombus, offering a new\ntherapeutic approach with a high safety profile. This study aims\nto evaluate the efficacy of GPVI inhibitor, glenzocimab, in\naddition to EVT.\nThe current protocol allows any Standard of Care to be used for\nthrombolysis, depending on routine practice in each study site.\nIn particular, the simpler mode of administration of\ntenecteplase with its single bolus injection, led many sites to adopt tenecteplase as an alternative to alteplase for all AIS\npatients.",

        "Scientific justification": "Current medical treatment of Crohn disease (CD) consists\nof immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids,\nazathioprine, methotrexate, anti-TNF monoclonal\nantibodies). These agents control symptoms of CD in most\npatients but their withdrawal leads to disease relapse.\nThey are also associated with serious side effects\n(infections, lymphoma, cancer, liver toxicity). Anti-TNF\nmonoclonal antibodies are the most efficient but are cost\nprohibitive. Moreover, each year, roughly 10% of\nresponders to anti-TNF become refractory to treatment,\nmost often because they become tolerized to these drugs.\nFuture CD drugs are small molecules or biologics that\nantagonize pro-inflammatory cytokines or gut homing of\nlymphocytes. Yet, they have similar safety issues as the\nimmunosuppressive agents currently in use.\nThe current therapeutic algorithm for CD does not take into\naccount the site of inflammation or composition of\nintestinal microbiota. Moreover, dysregulated intestinal\nimmunity and overproduction of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines are not the only components of CD\npathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and\nplays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E.\ncoli specie with adhesive and invasive properties,\nadherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in\nileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in\n36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls\nThe role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated\nin several laboratories around the world and has shown\nthat AIEC is pro-inflammatory and could play an important\nrole in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As\nsuch, it may be an important therapeutic target. This\nrandomized trial proposes a novel approach to the\ntreatment of CD. It is individualized to patients colonized\nwith AIEC who will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics\nthat have been shown to be active against the bacteria in\nvitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks.\nWe hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in\npatients who have been randomized into the experimental\narm.

        "Scientific justification": "Non-Favorable AML in older patients is an unmet\nmedical need.\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous\nclonal myeloid neoplasm where abnormal proliferation\nand impaired differentiation of hematopoietic stem and\nmyeloid progenitor cells impedes normal hematopoiesis.\nDespite the significant progress made in understanding\nAML oncogenesis over the past decades, this disease\nremains devastating with about 18,000 new cases every\nyear in Europe and a five-year overall survival of only\n17%.1\nThe median age at diagnosis of AML is 69 years and the\ncure rate of patients older than 60 has not improved in\nthe recent decades.2 The standard of care (SOC) of\nnewly diagnosed AML includes a ‘7+3’ cytarabine-\nanthracyclin combination followed by repeated courses\nof high dose cytarabine with or without allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).3\nRecent advances in this SOC approach include the\naddition of the multikinase inhibitor midostaurine during\ninduction and consolidation in patients with FLT3 gene\nmutations,4 maintenance with oral azacitidine after\ncompletion of induction with or without consolidation in\npatients ineligible for transplantation,5 and use of a\nliposomal formulation of the cytarabine-daunorubicin\ncombination instead of conventional 7+3 in patients with\nhigh-risk features.6\nIn patients older than 60y with adequate performance\nstatus and few comorbidities deemed ‘fit’ for intensive\nchemotherapy, a 7+3 induction course combining 3 days\nof idarubicin (IDA) with a 7-day continuous cytarabine\n(AraC) infusion can induce complete remission (CR) or\nCR with incomplete platelet recovery in 64% of cases\nwith non-favorable cytogenetics.7 Recent advances in\nthe supportive care of these patients, notably\nprogresses in the anti-fungal armementarium, have\nlowered the toxicity of the 7+3 induction courses, with\nearly date (ED) rates within the 5-10% range.8 However,\ndespite high CR and low ED rates with 7+3, the median\nevent-free survival (EFS) remains 9.3 months in patients\n≥60 years old with non-favorable cytogenetics, owing to\nfrequent relapses.7 Improving the anti-leukemic efficacy\nof the 7+3 induction course can contribute to better long-\nterm prognosis in these patients.9 However, modifications of the 7+3 induction course must rely on\nany additional toxicity to limit the risk of ED, and not to\njeopardize post-remission therapy. Repositioning of\ndrugs with excellent safety profiles appears as a\npromising approach in this regard.10\nAs such, non-favorable risk AML in older patients\nrepresents an unmet medical need. Novel options to\nimprove the efficacy of the 7+3 induction course are thus\nnecessary.\nEnd of Induction Measurable Residual Disease predicts\nlong-term outcome in older AML patients treated\nintensively.\nStandardization of molecular techniques and\ndevelopment of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC)\nassays have made it possible to assess Measurable\nResidual Disease (MRD) at different time points during\nthe course of AML therapy in virtually all patients.11\nIn older patients treated with 7+3, MRD measured at the\nend of induction course (EOI) time point based on\nNPM1c transcripts in NPM1-mutated patients, or with\nMFC assays (Leukemia Aberrant ImmunoPhenotypes\n[LAIP] and/or Leukemic Stem Cell [LSC) methods)\npredict long-term outcome.12 In NPM1-mutated patients\nyounger than 60, the role of EOI MRD assessed by\nrelative NPM1c transcript levels is also well\nestablished,13 although data is scarcer in older\npatients.14 Altogether, EOI MRD appears a relevant\nsurrogate endpoint to estimate efficacy of alternative\ninduction regimens in older AML patients with non-\nfavorable cytogenetics.\nCystine import is a targetable vulnerability in AML.\nThe metabolic rewiring of leukemic cells is increasingly\nrecognized as a targetable vulnerability in AML.\nLeukemic Stem Cells (LSCs) endowed with increased\nquiescence and chemoresistance,15 have specific\nmetabolic profiles that may for instance underpin the\nremarkable efficacy of the azacitidine-venetoclax\ncombination in patients ineligible for 7+3.16,17 LSCs\nnotably rely on high levels of the cysteine amino acid to\nfuel glutathione synthesis and maintain low levels of\nReactive Oxygen Species (ROS).18 Chemical depletion\nof the intracellular pools of cysteine and its precursor\ncystine have pre-clinical anti-leukemic activity in vitro.19\nBy querying transcriptional profiles of multiple AML\npatients’ cohorts, we have identified a close correlation\nbetween the expression of stemness programs and an\nactive cysteine metabolism pathway. Querying a CrispR\nscreen conducted in 500+ cancer cell lines revealed a\nspecific dependence of AML cell lines on cysteine\nmetabolism. Among genes belonging to this pathway,\nhigher expression of SLC7A11 was identified to bear\npoor prognostic relevance in 3 AML cohorts. Genetic silencing of SLC7A11 reduced viability and\ncolony formation of AML cell lines in a cysteine-\ndependent fashion. SLC7A11 encodes the xCT neutral\namino acid antiporter that imports cystine against\nglutamate. The xCT antiport is broadly expressed in\nAML cell lines. Three chemical inhibitors of xCT with\ndifferent chemical backbones including erastin, S-4-\nCarboxyphenylglycine (CpG) and sulfasalazine (SSZ)\nhad highly concordant, cystine-dependent, anti-\nleukemic activity on a panel of 20 AML cell lines. These\ndata suggested that cystine import could represent a\ntargetable vulnerability in AML.\nSulfasalazine can be repurposed to inhibit cystine import\nin AML.\nSulfasalazine (SSZ) is a broadly available, well tolerated\nanti-inflammatory medicine approved for the treatment\nof ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis.20 Intact\nSSZ, but not its metabolites 5‐aminosalicylic acid and\nsulfapyridine, competitively inhibits xCT.21 SSZ is thus\nan ideal candidate for drug repurposing in AML. In vitro,\nSSZ inhibited the viability of 12 primary AML specimens,\nwith a > 10-fold increased sensitivity compared to\nCD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from\nheathly donors (SSZ IC50 in AML 176µM ± 40µM versus\n2.94mM ± 4.21mM in healthy CD34+ cells, p=0.0011).\nSSZ 250µM, a concentration in the same range as peak\nplasma concentrations of SSZ in healthy individuals,22\nalso significantly reduced the in vitro long-term culture\ninitiating potential of 6 primary AML samples. Finally,\ntwice-daily intraperitoneal administration of single agent\nSSZ significantly reduced the leukemic burden in two\ndistinct AML patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models.\nFinally, compassionate administration of oral SSZ at 3-\n6 g/d over a 20-day period in a patient with advanced\nrefractory AML resulted in a transient, but clinically\nmeaningful cytoreduction. Mechanistic studies found\nSSZ to induce global metabolic rewiring of the cysteine\nand one-carbon pathway, resulting in glutathione\ndepletion and ROS-dependent cell death partly\ncorresponding to ferroptosis,23 Total protein expression\nof SLC7A11 did not correlate with SSZ activity. Thus,\nSSZ can be repurposed to inhibit cystine import and\nimpair leukemic viability in AML.\nSulfasalazine improves the efficacy of anthracycline-\ncytarabine combination chemotherapy in pre-clinical\nAML models.\nIn two distinct AML cell lines, the anthracycline\ndaunorubicin (DNR) was identified among a panel of 8\nAML drugs as the one with top synergism when\ncombined with SSZ. This observation may be\nunderpinned by the ROS-inducing potential of\nanthracyclins.24 In a cohort of 48 primary AML samples, addition of SSZ at a low concentration (4 µM) mimicking\ntrough concentrations in healthy donors,22 significantly\nincreased the anti-leukemic activity of the combination\nof DNR with araC on both the total leukemic bulk and on\nGPR56+ LSCs in a niche-like ex vivo drug screening\nplatform combining stromal co-culture, hypoxia and\nplasma-like medium.25 Finally, addition of SSZ with a\nregimen combining 3 days of the anthracycline\nadriamycin with 5 days of cytarabine (maximally\ntolerated regimen in immunocompromised NOG-EXL\nmice) further decreased the leukemic burden in a PDX\nmodel and significantly prolonged survival over\nadriamycin-cytarabine chemotherapy alone (Pardieu et\nal, manuscript in preparation, data to be presented at the\n2021 Annual Meeting of the European Hematology\nAssociation). These data support the clinical evaluation\nof the addition of SSZ with 7+3 in AML.\nAddition of sulfasalazine to standard of care\nchemotherapies is manageable.\nRepurposing of SSZ to inhibit xCT has been investigated\nalone or with standards of care chemotherapies in solid\ntumors.26-28\nA first study conducted of single-agent SSZ in 10 highly\ndebilitated patients with high grade, progressing\nglioblastomas was terminated prematurely based on\nlack of efficacy. In this trial, the toxicity of SSZ at low\ndoses (1.5-6 g/d) was mostly neurological, suggestive of\ntumor-specific poor tolerability possibly caused by drug-\nrelated peri-tumoral edema. 26\nConversely, another dose-escalation study of single-\nagent SSZ up to 12 g/d for 14 days in 11 patients with\nadvanced gastric cancer identified 12 g/d as MTD with\ngrade 3 anorexia as DLT. Other grade 3 AES included\nelevated AST (n=1) and bilirubin (n=1), fatigue (n=2),\nnausea (n=1), vomiting (n=1) and hyponatremia (n=1).\nThere was no grade ≥ 3 hematological or grade 4 non-\nhematological AE in this trial. The median number of\nSSZ cycles was 2 (range 1–4) with a mean relative dose\nintensity of 85% for dose level 1 (8 g/d) and 60% at MTD\n(12 g/d).28\nFinally, a phase 1 study combining SSZ thrice daily for\n21 days with cisplatin and pemetrexed on day 1 of each\nSSZ cycle was conducted in 15 patients with advanced\nnon-small-cell lung cancers.\nThe MTD was 3 g/day, and the recommended phase 2\ndose (RP2D) was 1.5 g/day. DLTs included grade 3\nelevations of AST and ALT aminotransferase levels,\nhypotension, pneumonitis, and anorexia. Overall, the\ncombination appeared manageable, and promising\nactivity was noted in terms of overall response rate\nprogression-free survival compared to historical\ncontrols.27 The anti-tumor activity of SSZ continues to be\nexplored in solid tumors (NCT NCT04205357). Overall, addition of SSZ to chemotherapy appears feasible in\ncarefully designed dose escalation phase 1 trials.\nCollectively, these pre-clinical findings provide a strong\nrationale for the clinical evaluation of the addition of\nsulfasalazine to standard of care 7+3 induction regimen\nin non-favorable AML patients older than 60 years. The\npurpose of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety\nand feasibility of such strategy, provide preliminary\nsignals of efficacy, and identify potential biomarkers.",

        "Scientific justification": "Pediatric patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA)\nrespond better than adults to immunosuppressive\ntherapy (IST) but the long-term risks of relapse,\nciclosporine dependence, and clonal evolution are high.\nUK investigators reported a 5-year estimated failure-free\nsurvival (FFS) after IST of 13.3%. In contrast, in 44\nsuccessive children who received a matched unrelated\ndonor (MUD), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n(HSCT), there was an excellent estimated 5-year FFS of\n95%. Forty of these children had previously failed IST.\nBecause of those excellent results, up-front fully matched\nunrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation (HSCT) became an attractive first-line\noption. In 2005 to 2014, a UK cohort of 29 children with\nidiopathic AA thus received MUD HSCTs as first-line\ntherapy (they did not receive IST prior to HSCT). Results\nwere excellent, with low Graft versus Host Disease rates\nand only 1 death (idiopathic pneumonia). This cohort was\nthen compared with historical matched controls,\ntransplanted or not. Outcomes for the up-front unrelated\ncohort HSCT were similar to Matched Related Donor\nHSCT and superior to IST and unrelated HSCT post-IST\nfailure. Since then, many investigators are offering up-\nfront MUD HSCT in pediatric patients worldwide.\nHowever, those results should be treated with extreme\ncaution: 1) the design is retrospective; 2) the excellent up-\nfront MUD HSCT may arise from the use of alemtuzumab\nin the conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab is not easily\navailable worldwide) and 3) there was no formal quality-\nof-life assessment. Moreover, this strategy is highly\ndependent on donor identification (Caucasian patients\nhave the highest likelihood of having a MUD) and donor\navailability. We thus don’t know how many patients did\nnot eventually receive HSCT because of the risk of\ninfections/complications caused by unexpected donor\ndelays or cancellation. Prospective trials are thus urgently\nneeded to address the feasibility of such procedure, in\nterm of timing (delay to offer MUD HSCT) and\nconditioning regimen (nothing is known of the use of other\nregimens, non alemtuzumab-based, in this setting).",

This\nsituation thus represents today a very challenging unmet\nmedical need.\nRecently, haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell\nTransplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically\noutcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of\npost-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which\ntargets alloreactive T cells generated early after an HLA-\nmismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and\nleaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem\ncells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression\nwith a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate\nmofetil (3). Our group re-transplanted a patient who\nexperienced two consecutive graft failures and was\nsuccessfully managed through a third haplo-SCT from\nher son using PTCy (5). We then retrospectively collected\nand analyzed data from 26 primary graft failure patients\ntransplanted between 2011 and 2017 in 15 centers on\nbehalf of French Society for Stem Cell Transplantation\nand Cell Therapy (SFGM-TC). The study population\nconsisted mainly of patients with primary or secondary\n(within the 60 days post-transplantation) graft failure who\nunderwent haplo-SCT and received PTCy as graft-\nversus-host-disease prophylaxis.

Few retrospective non-controlled\nregistry studies recently suggest that outcomes after\nhaplo-SCT using PTCy approach might be superior to\nactual standard of care (i.e. retransplantation from an\nunrelated donor). Moreover, haplo-SCT with PTCy is a\nquick procedure, cheap, and available for almost all\npatients.

In the French study (n=162), 72% patients with a\ndonor received HSCT, previously treated by hypomethylating\nagent (HMA) in 71% of them.3 There was a trend to a better\nsurvival in patients achieving a complete remission with pre-\ngraft therapy (HR: 0.55, p=0.088) and higher risk of death in\nunresponsiveness patients transformed into AML (HR: 2.36,\np=0.008). In Nakamura’s study (n=384), 83% of patients with\na donor were transplanted, previously treated by HMA in\n68%2. The multivariable Cox model for Overall Survival (OS)\nand Leukemia-free survival showed an excess risk in patients\ntreated by HMA. Moreover, responders still have a higher risk\nof mortality as compared to patients who did not receive any\npre-graft therapy (HR: 2.417, p=0.0054). In the German\nstudy, the aim was to initiate azacytidine at inclusion and to\ntransplant patients after 4 cycles if a donor was identified1.\nAmong 170 registered patients, 162 initiated 5-aza but 36%\nof them were “lost during this pre-graft therapy” before\nallocation to “donor” or “no-donor” arm, for different reasons\nincluding death (n=12). After 4 cycles of 5-aza, 79/81 patients\n“donor arm” were transplanted. The multivariable analysis\nshowed remission status did not influence OS. Those 3\nprevious clinical trials thus suggest that a substantial number\nof patients planned for transplantation are not transplanted\nnowadays while no evidence of HMA benefit before HSCT\nhas been clearly identified.

        "Scientific justification": "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a major\ntherapeutic option for patients with acquired aplastic anemia\n(AA). Improved survival has been achieved in patients younger\nthan 40 years old, thanks to better donor selection, conditioning\nregimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, together\nwith improved supportive care.\nHowever, this has never been the case for patients over the age\nof 40 for whom the overall survival after HSCT never exceeded\n60% at 5 years using available sibling or unrelated donor\n(Ref#3). Thus, the standard immunosuppressive therapy\n(IST) associating cisclosporine, horse anti-thymocyte globuline,\ntogether with the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG) is now\nconsidered as the standard of care in adult patients older than\n40 years with AA (ref#1).\nIndeed, outcomes for patients who are refractory to first-line IST\nremain poor because of the lack of other non-transplant\ntreatment and because of the poor results of transplantation\nat this age (Ref#2, 37). During the past 2 decades, there has\nbeen a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in this\npopulation after initial IST but risk of hemorrhage and long-term\nfatigue are still present. Moreover, clonal evolution including\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic\nsyndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur\nin the long-term with a grim prognosis for MDS/AML (Ref#2).\nThe overall survival of such adult patients with acquired AA\nrefractory or in relapse after IST outside HSCT is thus about\n60% at 2 years (ref #2).\nRecently, new strategies to prevent acute and chronic graft\nversus host disease, including T-cell replete grafts with\nadministration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide\n(PTCy), have revolutionized the field.\nThese changes extended the option of HSCT primary for\npatients with refractory/relapse AA who lack an HLA matched\ndonor (Ref#4). More recently the optimized Baltimore protocol\nusing PTCy strategy also appears to improve engraftment and\nreduce graft versus host disease (GvHD) in other more\nclassical setting (sibling and matched unrelated HSCT outside\nAA) (Ref#5). One of the first cause of death after HSCT in\npatients older than 40 years of age with refractory/relapse AA\nis GvHD and the use of the optimized Baltimore protocol for all\ntype of donors (haplo but also sibling and matched unrelated transplantation) within the field of AA rapidly appears promising\n(Ref#6&7).\nUsing an optimized HSCT procedure (marrow as source of\nstem cells and a PTCy strategy) not only in haplo-identical\ndonor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling\nor unrelated donor might prevent drastically GvHD and\neventually be practice changing. Evaluating this new transplant\nprotocol as a new strategy is the main objective of “APARR”.",

Each infusion of Rituximab will be preceded by\nadministration of anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g.\nparacetamol and diphenhydramine\nNB: However, it is permissible to delay the administration of rituximab\nby 24 hours if D+5 occurs on a Sunday for greater safety at the\ndiscretion of the investigator",
        "Interventions added for the\nstudy": "No additional test or specific examinations except the quality-\nof-life questionnaire.\nRituximab is considered as added by the research and\nprovided by the sponsor.",
        "Expected benefits for the\nparticipants and for society": "Outcomes for adult patients with refractory/relapse AA older\nthan 40 years remain poor. HSCT is the sole therapeutically\nvalid option but results have always been very disappointing\nand transplantation is currently rarely possible. An optimized\nHSCT protocol not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also\nin case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might\nprevent GvHD and eventually drastically improve the outcome\nof HSCT in patients older than 40 years with refractory/relapse\nAA.\nThere are direct benefits for patients since no curative and safe\noptions are available so far. In the absence of transplantation,\npatients aged 40 years or more with refractory/relapse AA after\nIST are thus exposed to infections risk, hemorrhage, prolonged\nfatigue but also on the long-term clonal evolution including\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) as well as\nmyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia\n(AML), both with a grim prognosis.\nA global health care benefit will also be possible since those\npatients won’t need any more medical support including\nhospitalization but also daily hospital care (antibiotics or need\nfor transfusions).",
        "Risks and burdens added by the\nstudy": "Rituximab injection\nRisk level of the study: D",
        "Practical implementation": "Indication of HSCT in patients with refractory/relapse AA aged\nmore than 40 years who are refractory or in relapse after first-\nline IST",
        "Number of participants included": "52 patients",
        "Number of centres": "28 centers affiliated at SFGM-TC in France",
        "Duration of the study": "Inclusion period: 36 months\nParticipation period (BMT + follow-up): 24 months\nTotal duration: 60 months",
        "Number of enrolments expected\nper site and per month": "0,05 patient/centre/month",
        "Statistical analysis": "Sample size calculation\nA two-sided, one-sample log-rank test calculated from a sample\nof 52 subjects achieves 80% power at a 0.05 significance level\nto detect a 2-years GRFS of 70% in the new group when the 2-\nyears GRFS in the historic control group is 50% if all patients\nare followed 2 years.\nAnalysis of primary endpoint\nSeveral interim analyses of the primary outcome measure are\nplanned once every 12 months (unless less than 20 enrolled\npatients), based on a Bayesian approach.\nAt the end of the trial (accrual+follow-up), GRFS will be\nestimated using Kaplan Meier method with its corresponding\n95% confidence interval and compared to historical rate using\none sample two-sided log-rank test.\nAn additional terminal analysis will use external patients from\nan observational cohort, with propensity score weighting, to\nensure an unbiased comparison and enhance the level of\nevidence of the treatment effect.",
