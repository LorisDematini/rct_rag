    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-\nHSCT) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).\nMost of the patients requiring an allo-HSCT are above 50\nyears of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity\nconditioning (RIC) regimen. The optimal RIC and GVHD\nprophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the\ndisease while preventing GVHD remains to be\ndetermined for elderly patients. A phase III trial comparing\nthe conventional RIC fludarabine-busulfan 2 days to\nfludarabine-treosulfan demonstrated an advantage for\nthe flu-treosulfan arm in terms of event free survival\n(EFS), that should therefore be considered as the new\nstandard of RIC regimen for AML and MDS. GVHD\nprevention has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes\nby potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia\n(GVL) effect and immune reconstitution. Anti-thymocyte\nglobulins (ATG) are recommended to reduce the risk of\nacute and chronic GVHD in transplants performed with\nmatched unrelated donors. However, the optimal type of\nATG between the 2 approved brands (ATG-\nthymoglobulin and ATLG-grafalon) displaying distinct\ncharacteristics and the optimal dose of ATG are still\nunknown. In a retrospective study of patients\ntransplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and\nunrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we\nobserved that ATLG was associated with a reduction of\ngrade II-IV acute GVHD in comparison to ATG without\nincreasing the incidence of relapse."

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100\n000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory\nDisease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence\n/ prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the\n3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of\nflares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality.\nPrognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in\naddition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains\npejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-\n15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective\nclinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness.\nNew biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited\nbreakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys\nmonocolonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE.\nIn addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal\nLeukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients\nhas dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er\nor 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more\neffective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new\nimmunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\nAccording to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to\ninduce tissue repair mechanisms, Mesenchymal Stem cells (MSC) have\nbeen proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use\nof allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and\nhuman clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in\nChina. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity\ncriteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys\ntherapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into\naccount criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal\nclinical trials.

      "Main backgrounds: 1. ALL is now a curable disease in 80-90% of children and 70-80% of the adolescents.\nNevertheless numerous problems remain\nThese good results are obtained with intensive and prolonged treatments which\ninclude risk of toxic death, sequelae, and secondary malignancies.\nResults are still insufficient for high-risk forms, particularly those exhibiting an early\nresistance to chemotherapy\nEarly bone marrow relapses (less than 30 months after diagnosis) still have a dismal\nprognosis which renders their prevention mandatory\nALL is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of biology and response to\ntreatment. To envisage targeted treatments in the future renders key to decipher this\nheterogeneity.\nThe two cooperative groups FRALLE and the French centers of the EORTC-CLCG have\ndecided to elaborate a common protocol for the treatment of childhood and\nadolescent ALL: Childhood and Adolescent ALL-France- 01(CAALL-F01).\nThe two previous studies from these groups have comparable results:\nEvent-Free Survival Overall Survival\n5 years 8 years 5 years 8 years\nFRALLE 2000\n(2146 pts) 84.0% 82% 91% 89%\nEORTC 58951\n(1947pts) 82.6%, 81.3% 89.7% 88.1%\n2. A still major question in the field of ALL is the optimal use of L-asparaginase\n(ASNase)\nIt is known that administering ASNase results in the depletion of asparagine\ncirculating in the blood, which starves the leukemic cells and results in their death.\nBut indeed the use of ASNase varies between protocols considering the different\nbrands, the dose and the administration modalities (rythm, route-IM or IV).\nThree major forms of ASNase are currently available: E. coli asparaginase (Kidrolase®\nin France), Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase®, for patients with allergy) and a pegylated\nform of E.coli Asparaginase (Oncaspar® in USA and in Europe).\n2.1.Oncaspar®in the USA\nOncaspar® (PEGylated E. coli asparaginase or pegaspargase manufactured initially by\nENZON and now SHIRE/Servier) was developed with the goal of reducing the\nimmunogenicity of the native ASNase. In addition, Oncaspar®, because of its\nprolonged serum terminal half-life (t1/2), can be dosed less frequently than native\nASNase with achievement of similar PD.\nIn the USA, CCG-1962 was the pivotal clinical trial supporting first-line use of\nOncaspar®. Children with standard risk ALL (n=118) were randomized to receive\nnative or PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (API from Merck) as part of induction and 2\ndelayed intensifications (DI) phases.

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Outcomes for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are\nrefractory to first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and who\nlack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor. Recently, the\nuse of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in\n40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not\nrespond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore\nexposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the\npast 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-\nrelated mortality in patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but\nclonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n(PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid\nleukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis.\nOverall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired\nrefractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years (2).\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative\ndonor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood\n(CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in\npatients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of\ncomplications than in transplantations from matched related or\nunrelated donors. Recently, our group showed that CBT is a\nvaluable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA (3).\nHowever, not all patients have available CB and CBT treatment\nrelated mortality is high in adult patients. Haploidentical (haplo)\nrelated donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have\nimproved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with\nadministration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy).\nPreliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory SAA\nat Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA)\nseem promising (4, 5). We retrospectively analyzed data from 36\npatients (median age 42 years) transplanted between 2010 and\n2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the European\nBlood and Marrow Transplantation group. The 1-year overall\nsurvival was about 80% suggesting that this approach might be a\nvalid option in this particular poor clinical situation (6)."

    ],
    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation\nassociated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted\nby immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic\nposttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration,\nin association with local or systemic therapies as\nchemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and\nendemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression\ncannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified,\nmostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS.\nMost aggressive forms with visceral involvement are\ntreated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at\nbest 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well\ntolerated in elderly patients.\nTalimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic\nimmunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or\nunresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or\ncutaneous lesions. It is designed to induce tumor\nregression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects,\nand of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic\nantitumor immunity.\nIn Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced\ntumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have\nproven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that\nimmunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors.\nTwo cases of metastatic MCC succesfully treated with\ntalimogene laherparepvec were recently reported,\nsuggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an\neffective therapeutic option. Considering the high\nimmunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of\nthe immune evasion in the development of KS, and the\ncutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be\neasily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor\nmodel to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec."

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: The only curative treatment in patients with primary or\nsecondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem\ncells (HSCT). It has been reported that intermediate and\nhigher risk patients according to international prognostic\nscores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival (Kröger et\nal, 2015). In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective\ntrial testing the use of ruxolitinib before transplantation\n(“JAK-ALLO study” NCT01795677). Outcome of patients\nwas better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling\ndonor than an unrelated donor confirming other studies\n(Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO\ntrial, acute GVHD incidence was high, often hyperacute\nand severe. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a\nregistry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation\n(haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018).\nPost-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of\ncases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free\nsurvival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which favorably\ncompared to outcome after unrelated transplantation.\nGenova team has also reported impressive results after\nhaplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et\nal, 2015). Bregante et al have reported outcome of 2\ncohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to\n2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the\nmore frequent use of haplo in the second period (54%\nversus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second\nperiod with OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest\nthat this improvement is related to the best outcome\namong haplo transplantation. The improvement of\noutcome after haplo has been attributed to a better GVHD\nprophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant\ncyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after\nunrelated transplantation and especially in HLA\nmismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in\nfamily haplo identical transplantation, this current study\nproposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in\nmyelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor."

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD)\nhas dramatically improved over the last decades in the US and\nEurope, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many\nchildren and most adults develop a chronic debilitating\ncondition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem\ncell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative\napproach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children\ntransplanted from a matched related donor (MRD) after a\nmyeloablative conditioning regimen(1),(2). To date, few studies\nhave addressed the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk\nof graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to the toxicity\nexpected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage.\nThe development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning\nregimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid GVHD\nappears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with\nsevere SCD. Four groups have previously reported encouraging\nresults in a total of 81 patients transplanted from matched\nrelated mobilized peripheral blood cells after a non-\nmyeloablative conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab and low\ndose of total body irradiation (TBI)) followed by post-transplant\nsirolimus. These studies demonstrate a high SCD free survival\nrate (no death related to transplant, 6 graft failures) and no\nGVHD. Ninety two percent of these patients were cured with\nnormalized hemoglobin levels, resolution of hemolysis and\nstable hemoglobin A levels identical to the proportion observed\nin the donor(3–6). However, outcome comparison of patients\ntransplanted with patients not transplanted are lacking. We\ndesign a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15\nyears with severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative\ntransplant (when a matched related donor (MRD) is identified)\nversus no HSCT (for patients lacking MRD)."

However,\nAHSCT is contra-indicated in case of advanced visceral\ninvolvement and in eligible patients, it is still associated\nwith risk of toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify\nsafe and effective treatments for severe SSc.\nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells\nwhich carry immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-\nfibrotic properties, that can target SSc pathogenesis and\nits clinical manifestations. The increasing use of MSC,\nharvested from bone marrow (MSC(M)), adipose tissue\n(MSC(AT)), or umbilical cord (MSC(UC)) in a variety of\nindications, provides consistent evidence supporting their\nsafety in humans. The efficacy of MSC(M) intravenous\n(IV) injection for treating acute graft versus host disease\nled to their marketing approval in 2012 and MSC(AT)\n(Alofisel) were approved for severe Crohn’s fistula in\n2018.\nMSC represent a promising therapeutic approach for\nSSc.

This condition remains associated\nwith a high morbidity and mortality, with hospital mortality\nof 60% when vasopressors are required.\nFull protective isolation (including geographic isolation,\ntechnical isolation, high-efficiency air filtration, and\ndigestive decontamination) proved to be efficient in\npatients with profound and prolonged neutropenia with\nregard to infection rate. However, these studies are biased\nand were performed up to 40 years ago. More recent\nstudies, performed in patients with less profound\nneutropenia, or performed without digestive\ndecontamination or with partial protective isolation led\nhowever to negative results. More importantly, isolation\nhas been demonstrated to limit access to patients’ room\nand to be associated with suboptimal monitoring, with\nincreased rate of severe and avoidable adverse events.\nThis may explain the uneven use of protective isolation in\nhematology ward and expert’s suggestion to appraise\nprotective isolation benefits using large well conducted\nRCT.\nIn neutropenic patients with suspected sepsis, urgent\nbroad antibiotic therapy is mandatory and failure to initiate\nadequate antibiotic therapy within 1 hour has been\nassociated with a 10 fold increase in adjusted mortality.\nCurrent IDSA guidelines recommend using preferentially\nlarge anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam therapy.

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a vasculitis of unknown origin, resulting in\nprogressive thickening and stenosis of large and medium arteries\n(the aorta and its major branches, and the pulmonary arteries). First\nline therapy of TA consists of high dose corticosteroids (CS)\n(Mukhtyar et al, 2009). Between 20 and 50% of cases respond to CS\nalone, with subsequent resolution of symptoms and stabilization of\nvascular abnormalities (Shelhamer et al, 1985; Maksimowicz-\nMcKinnon et al, 2007). Although second-line agents (methotrexate,\nazathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil) may result in\ninitial remission, relapses remain common when prednisone is\ntapered (Maksimowicz-McKinnon et al, 2007). Thus, 50% of CS-\nresistant or relapsing TA patients may achieve sustained remission\nwith the addition of methotrexate (Hoffman et al, 1994). During the\nlast decade, biologics such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-\nTNFα) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) have been used as third-line\ntreatment in refractory or relapsing TA. Almost 90% of CS–\nmethotrexate resistant TA cases responded to infliximab, an anti-\nTNFα, and sustained remission was obtained in 37 to 76% of the\ncases (Schmidt et al, 2012; Comarmond et al, 2012; Mekinian et al,\n2012). Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 has given similar results with 68% of\nsustained remission in refractory TA (Abisror et al, 2013). Irrespective\nof classical cardiovascular risk factors, the systemic inflammation and\nCS use play a pivotal role in the occurrence of cardiovascular\nthrombotic events (CVEs) (Roubille et al, 2015). As CVEs overlap with\nTA complications it is primordial to drastically taper CS in that\nvasculitis. We therefore hypothesize that Infliximab or Tocilizumab\ncan achieve a remission in more than 70% of refractory/relapsing TA\ncases to CS associated to a second-line agent. INTOReTAK, first\nrandomized prospective study in TA, has an original design testing\nInfliximab and Tocilizumab propensity to achieve over 70% of\nsustained remission in refractory/relapsing TA and evaluating jointly\nthe 2 arms."

      "Scientific justification: Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is associated with significant\nmorbidity and mortality, and requires therapeutic\nintervention. The management of noninfectious mixed\ncryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on\ncorticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade,\nseveral groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-\nCD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with\ncryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved\neffective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete\nclinical response in 65-70% of patients. However,\ncryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40%\npatients within few days to nineteen months after the last\nrituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown\nthat serum BLys concentration was correlated with\nserum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia\nvasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non-\nHodgkin’s lymphoma. In agreement with data in systemic\nlupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, we also\nobserved decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining\nwhich was correlated with disease severity. Following\nrituximab serum BLys concentration significantly\nincreased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B\ncell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A\nrecent study has shown that rituximab does not reset\ndefective early B cell tolerance checkpoints. An obvious\nsolution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from\nprecipitating a flare of disease following rituximab\ntherapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of\ndisease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF\nblockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and\nBAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone\nand follicular compartments more effectively than either\ntreatment alone. A combination of B cell depletion and\nBAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone\nwith respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts\nand plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity,\nin three different mouse models of lupus.

      "Scientific justification: Primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL) is a rare form of plasma cell\nmalignancy (2-4% of multiple myeloma) with poor prognosis\n(overall survival (OS) < 12 months with conventional\nchemotherapy). Bortezomib-based regimens have shown\npromising results in small retrospective studies, and transplantation\n(auto and/or allograft) may improve OS for selected young patients.\nThe IFM group recently published a prospective study in 40 pPCL\npatients, with alternate Bortezomib-Dexamethasone-\nDoxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide (PAD/VCD) as induction before\nhigh dose Melphalan plus autologous stem cell transplantation\n(HDM/ASCT), followed by reduced intensity conditioning-allograft\n(RIC-Allo) or second HDM/ASCT plus consolidation/maintenance\nwith Bortezomib-Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone/Lenalidomide.\nOverall, 27 patients (69%) were responder to induction and 35%\nachieved VGPR or better; one patient underwent a syngeneic\nallograft and 25 HDM/ASCT: 16 of them subsequently received a\nRIC-allograft, 7 a second transplant followed by\nconsolidation/maintenance. The median PFS and OS were 15 and\n36 months, respectively. OS seems to be superior in the double\ntransplant/maintenance group compared to the allotransplant\ngroup on landmark analysis.\nThe Italian group also recently reported a prospective trial in pPCL\ninvolving 23 patients treated with lenalidomide-dexamethasone:\noverall the median PFS and OS were 14 and 28 months,\nrespectively. Nine of 15 patients eligible for transplant could receive\nHDM/ASCT after induction and PFS and OS were 27 months and\nnot reached, respectively.\nDaratumumab, a monoclonal antibody against CD38 that is highly\nexpressed by plasma cells, is highly effective in relapsed/refractory\npatients with multiple myeloma (MM), alone and in combination\nwith Lenalidomide.

Behçet’s disease (BD) is\na systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any\nsize, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD\nsignificantly increases morbidity and mortality. Therape\nutic management of BD depends on the clinical\npresentation and organ involved. Although colchicine,\nnonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical\ntreatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and\njoint involvement, more aggressive approach with\nimmunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe\nmanifestations such as retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular,\nor neurological involvement. Early recognition and\nvigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose\nsteroids have changed the prognosis of patients with\nsevere BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to\na 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel\nor neurological involvement. Cyclophosphamide has\nbeen used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However,\nthe outcome of severe complications of BD is still poor.\nThe European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)\nrecommendation (updated in 2016) for the management\nof BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNF plus\nglucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e\nneurological and/or major vessel involvement) but\nrecommendations on vascular disease and neurological\ninvolvement are based largely on expert opinion and\nuncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational\nstudies.

Types II and III are classified as mixed\ncryoglobulinaemia (MC) because they include both IgG\nand IgM components. Overall, cryoglobulinaemia is\nconsidered a rare disease (<5/10,000 in the general\nEuropean and North American population), although\nprevalence is likely to be higher in some areas such as the\nMediterranean Basin. MC vasculitis is a multi-organic\ndisease involving kidneys, joints, skin, and peripheral\nnerves. In type I cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis, searching\nfor an underlying plasma-cell neoplasms is mandatory.\nCryoglobulinaemia composed of IgG is more often found\nin multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammapathy of\nunknown significance (MGUS). The course of MC\nvasculitis varies widely and the prognosis is influenced by\nboth MC-induced damage to vital organs and co-\nmorbidities associated with underlying diseases. Type I\ncryoglobulinaemic vasculitis is a plasma cell associated\ndisorder at the crossroad between autoimmunity and\nplasma-cell neoplasm. Treatment should be modulated\naccording to the underlying associated disease and the\nseverity of internal organ involvement. The overall 10-year\nsurvival after a diagnosis of cryoglobulinaemic syndrome\nranges from 50% to 90% in case of renal involvement. The\nmain therapeutic goal must be the cure of the underlying\nhaematological disease (overwhelmingly plasma-cell\nneoplasms). The most common neoplasias are multiple\nmyeloma (predominantly associated with type I\ncryoglobulinaemia and hyperviscosity) in more than 50%\nof cases. Treating the underlying monoclonal disorder has\nbeen associated with improvement/stabilization of\ncryoglobulinaemic symptoms in most patients with type I\ncryoglobulinemia, although negativation of serum\ncryoglobulins was achieved in only half the patients."

      "Scientific justification: Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in\nsolid organ transplant recipients. In kidney transplant\nrecipients (KTR) urinary tract infection (UTI) represent\n45–72% of all infections, and 30% of all hospitalizations\nfor sepsis. Acute transplant pyelonephritis are the most\ncommon complications occurring in more than 20% of\npatients, mainly in the first year after transplantation. They\nare associated with an increased risk of acute kidney\nrejection and long-term kidney graft dysfunction. Gram-\nnegative bacteria, mainly E. coli, account for more than\n70% of UTI in KTR. As those infections are favored by\nurinary tract modifications/defects and\nimmunosuppression, they are often recurrent and\nnecessitate repeated courses of antibiotics. Selective\npressure due to antibiotic consumption, along with\nfrequent hospital admissions and immunosuppression,\nare well known risk factors for the development of\nantibiotic resistant infections. Multidrug (MDR)- or\nextensively (XDR)- drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae\nincluding ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing\norganisms, are thus increasingly observed in transplant\nunits and represent a global threat as very few new\nantibiotics are expected in the next decade.\nOne main strategy to limit antimicrobial resistance\nis to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment. A 7 day-\ncourse is recommended for simple acute pyelonephritis\n(APN) treated with fluoroquinolones or parenteral B-\nlactams, prolonged up to 10 or 14 days in the presence of\nunderlying disease at risk of complications. Most KT\nteams treat patients between 14–21 days as\nrecommended by American guidelines. However, the\nneed to extend treatment duration in immunosuppressed\npatients is a poorly defined concept and the optimal\nduration of treatment for APN in KTR is not known as\nthese patients are excluded from most studies."

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2\n(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has caused\nan international outbreak of respiratory illness described as\nCOVID-19. On the 22nd March 2020, 2920142 confirmed cases\nof COVID-19 including 12784 deaths were reported by The\nWorld Health Organization (1). On the 31 March 2020, there\nwere 52827 severe cases in France, including 3532 deaths.\nThe spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to\ncritical. If most infections are not severe, 15% of infected\npatients will require hospitalization and 5% will require intensive\ncare unit admission (2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nrelies on clinical symptoms and microbiological testing. To test\nfor SARS-CoV-2 infection, testing centers use a reverse-\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) on nasal\nswab in patients with productive cough. A number of\ninvestigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment\nof COVID-19. However, to date, there are no controlled data\nsupporting the use of any specific treatment (anti-viral drugs or\nimmunomodulatory drugs), and their efficacy for COVID-19 is\nunknown (3).\nSARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through the binding of its\nspike (S) protein to the membranous aminopeptidase called\nACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Among other\ntissues, ACE2 expression has mainly been found on\npneumocytes, enterocytes, renal tubular cells and podocytes.\nCellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires S protein priming by\ncellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein\ncleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (4).\nIn a murine model of SARS-CoV pneumonia, Iwata-Yoshikawa\net al. showed that TMPRSS2-KO mice had weakened\ninflammatory cytokine responses and reduced lung injury than\ncontrol mice (5). Hoffmann et al. found that a TMPRSS2\ninhibitor, the camostat mesylate, blocked viral entry and reduce\ninfection of human primary pneumocytes and lung cell lines by\nSARS-CoV-2. They also showed that the sera from\nconvalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-\ndriven entry (4). Another study performed by Bojkova et al (5)\nshowed that camostat mesylate reduced cytopathogenic effect\ndue to SARS-CoV-2 in human colonic cell lines. Camostat\nmesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that is commonly used in\nJapan (at a dose of 600 mg/day) and has been successfully\nand safely used to treat pancreatitis-associated pain (6) and\npost-operative reflux oesophagitis (7). Side effects that have\nbeen reported are rare at these doses (nausea, diarrhea,"

      "Scientific justification: Current medical treatment of Crohn disease (CD) consists\nof immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids,\nazathioprine, methotrexate, anti-TNF monoclonal\nantibodies). These agents control symptoms of CD in most\npatients but their withdrawal leads to disease relapse.\nThey are also associated with serious side effects\n(infections, lymphoma, cancer, liver toxicity). Anti-TNF\nmonoclonal antibodies are the most efficient but are cost\nprohibitive. Moreover, each year, roughly 10% of\nresponders to anti-TNF become refractory to treatment,\nmost often because they become tolerized to these drugs.\nFuture CD drugs are small molecules or biologics that\nantagonize pro-inflammatory cytokines or gut homing of\nlymphocytes. Yet, they have similar safety issues as the\nimmunosuppressive agents currently in use.\nThe current therapeutic algorithm for CD does not take into\naccount the site of inflammation or composition of\nintestinal microbiota. Moreover, dysregulated intestinal\nimmunity and overproduction of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines are not the only components of CD\npathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and\nplays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E.\ncoli specie with adhesive and invasive properties,\nadherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in\nileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in\n36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls\nThe role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated\nin several laboratories around the world and has shown\nthat AIEC is pro-inflammatory and could play an important\nrole in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As\nsuch, it may be an important therapeutic target. This\nrandomized trial proposes a novel approach to the\ntreatment of CD. It is individualized to patients colonized\nwith AIEC who will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics\nthat have been shown to be active against the bacteria in\nvitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks.\nWe hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in\npatients who have been randomized into the experimental\narm.

    ],
    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Pediatric patients with idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA)\nrespond better than adults to immunosuppressive\ntherapy (IST) but the long-term risks of relapse,\nciclosporine dependence, and clonal evolution are high.\nUK investigators reported a 5-year estimated failure-free\nsurvival (FFS) after IST of 13.3%. In contrast, in 44\nsuccessive children who received a matched unrelated\ndonor (MUD), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n(HSCT), there was an excellent estimated 5-year FFS of\n95%. Forty of these children had previously failed IST.\nBecause of those excellent results, up-front fully matched\nunrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplantation (HSCT) became an attractive first-line\noption. In 2005 to 2014, a UK cohort of 29 children with\nidiopathic AA thus received MUD HSCTs as first-line\ntherapy (they did not receive IST prior to HSCT). Results\nwere excellent, with low Graft versus Host Disease rates\nand only 1 death (idiopathic pneumonia). This cohort was\nthen compared with historical matched controls,\ntransplanted or not. Outcomes for the up-front unrelated\ncohort HSCT were similar to Matched Related Donor\nHSCT and superior to IST and unrelated HSCT post-IST\nfailure. Since then, many investigators are offering up-\nfront MUD HSCT in pediatric patients worldwide.\nHowever, those results should be treated with extreme\ncaution: 1) the design is retrospective; 2) the excellent up-\nfront MUD HSCT may arise from the use of alemtuzumab\nin the conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab is not easily\navailable worldwide) and 3) there was no formal quality-\nof-life assessment. Moreover, this strategy is highly\ndependent on donor identification (Caucasian patients\nhave the highest likelihood of having a MUD) and donor\navailability. We thus don’t know how many patients did\nnot eventually receive HSCT because of the risk of\ninfections/complications caused by unexpected donor\ndelays or cancellation. Prospective trials are thus urgently\nneeded to address the feasibility of such procedure, in\nterm of timing (delay to offer MUD HSCT) and\nconditioning regimen (nothing is known of the use of other\nregimens, non alemtuzumab-based, in this setting)."

      "Scientific justification: Prognosis of patients with graft failure is dismal, and re-\ntransplantation is the sole option for long-term survival.\nCurrently, there is no consensus concerning therapeutic\noptions in patients with primary or secondary (within the\n60 days post-transplantation) graft failure and finding a\nnew donor within an acceptable delay is challenging.\nLiterature is poor on the subject while the overall survival\nof such patients is about 30% at 1 year (1, 2). This\nsituation thus represents today a very challenging unmet\nmedical need.\nRecently, haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell\nTransplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically\noutcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of\npost-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which\ntargets alloreactive T cells generated early after an HLA-\nmismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and\nleaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem\ncells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression\nwith a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate\nmofetil (3). Our group re-transplanted a patient who\nexperienced two consecutive graft failures and was\nsuccessfully managed through a third haplo-SCT from\nher son using PTCy (5). We then retrospectively collected\nand analyzed data from 26 primary graft failure patients\ntransplanted between 2011 and 2017 in 15 centers on\nbehalf of French Society for Stem Cell Transplantation\nand Cell Therapy (SFGM-TC). The study population\nconsisted mainly of patients with primary or secondary\n(within the 60 days post-transplantation) graft failure who\nunderwent haplo-SCT and received PTCy as graft-\nversus-host-disease prophylaxis. The 1-year overall\nsurvival was about 60% suggesting that this approach\nmight be a valid option in this particular poor clinical\nsituation but now need validation through a phase II\nmulticenter, national, prospective cohort study (4)."

      "Scientific justification: Three recent prospective “transplant/no transplant” studies\nconcluded to an advantage of OS with transplantation in\npatients with high or intermediate-2 IPSS risk (not significant\nin Kröger’s study).1–3 No prospective randomized trial has\nassessed the pre-transplant therapy in MDS patients yet but\nsome information can be extracted from these 3 recent\nstudies. In the French study (n=162), 72% patients with a\ndonor received HSCT, previously treated by hypomethylating\nagent (HMA) in 71% of them.3 There was a trend to a better\nsurvival in patients achieving a complete remission with pre-\ngraft therapy (HR: 0.55, p=0.088) and higher risk of death in\nunresponsiveness patients transformed into AML (HR: 2.36,\np=0.008). In Nakamura’s study (n=384), 83% of patients with\na donor were transplanted, previously treated by HMA in\n68%2. The multivariable Cox model for Overall Survival (OS)\nand Leukemia-free survival showed an excess risk in patients\ntreated by HMA. Moreover, responders still have a higher risk\nof mortality as compared to patients who did not receive any\npre-graft therapy (HR: 2.417, p=0.0054). In the German\nstudy, the aim was to initiate azacytidine at inclusion and to\ntransplant patients after 4 cycles if a donor was identified1.\nAmong 170 registered patients, 162 initiated 5-aza but 36%\nof them were “lost during this pre-graft therapy” before\nallocation to “donor” or “no-donor” arm, for different reasons\nincluding death (n=12). After 4 cycles of 5-aza, 79/81 patients\n“donor arm” were transplanted. The multivariable analysis\nshowed remission status did not influence OS. Those 3\nprevious clinical trials thus suggest that a substantial number\nof patients planned for transplantation are not transplanted\nnowadays while no evidence of HMA benefit before HSCT\nhas been clearly identified. This phase 2 study aim to assess\nthe feasibility of upfront HSCT in patients with high risk MDS\nin order to increase the probability to be transplanted and to\nachieve a subsequent remission and better survival."

    "JUSTIFICATION": [
      "Scientific justification: Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a major\ntherapeutic option for patients with acquired aplastic anemia\n(AA). Improved survival has been achieved in patients younger\nthan 40 years old, thanks to better donor selection, conditioning\nregimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, together\nwith improved supportive care.\nHowever, this has never been the case for patients over the age\nof 40 for whom the overall survival after HSCT never exceeded\n60% at 5 years using available sibling or unrelated donor\n(Ref#3). Thus, the standard immunosuppressive therapy\n(IST) associating cisclosporine, horse anti-thymocyte globuline,\ntogether with the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG) is now\nconsidered as the standard of care in adult patients older than\n40 years with AA (ref#1).\nIndeed, outcomes for patients who are refractory to first-line IST\nremain poor because of the lack of other non-transplant\ntreatment and because of the poor results of transplantation\nat this age (Ref#2, 37). During the past 2 decades, there has\nbeen a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in this\npopulation after initial IST but risk of hemorrhage and long-term\nfatigue are still present. Moreover, clonal evolution including\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic\nsyndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur\nin the long-term with a grim prognosis for MDS/AML (Ref#2).\nThe overall survival of such adult patients with acquired AA\nrefractory or in relapse after IST outside HSCT is thus about\n60% at 2 years (ref #2).\nRecently, new strategies to prevent acute and chronic graft\nversus host disease, including T-cell replete grafts with\nadministration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide\n(PTCy), have revolutionized the field.\nThese changes extended the option of HSCT primary for\npatients with refractory/relapse AA who lack an HLA matched\ndonor (Ref#4). More recently the optimized Baltimore protocol\nusing PTCy strategy also appears to improve engraftment and\nreduce graft versus host disease (GvHD) in other more\nclassical setting (sibling and matched unrelated HSCT outside\nAA) (Ref#5). One of the first cause of death after HSCT in\npatients older than 40 years of age with refractory/relapse AA\nis GvHD and the use of the optimized Baltimore protocol for all\ntype of donors (haplo but also sibling and matched unrelated"
