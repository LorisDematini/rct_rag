There is no firm evidence or randomized trials that compared classical immunosuppressive compounds to biological agents; or identified the best treatment in this condition. The burden of NIU has been reduced with the use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, raising the question of which of these compounds should be preferentially used in recently active NIU with steroid dependency.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Primary Objective\nThe objective is to compare the efficacy of adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously) with that of standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil [2g/day orally] for 36 weeks) in recently active non-infectious intermediate, posterior uveitis, and pan-uveitis with steroid dependency.\nPrimary endpoint\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the treatment failure rate at 36 weeks. Treatment failure is defined by any of the following in at least one eye: \nnew active, inflammatory chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesions; \nworsening of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) by>3 lines;\n - 2- step increase in anterior chamber cell grade and/or in vitreous haze relative to baseline\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary Objectives:\nComparing adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously) to standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil [(2g/day orally)] for 36 weeks):\nTo evaluate the cumulative incidence of treatment failure up to W55 after inclusion\nTo evaluate the change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, logMAR) from baseline to week W55 ; \nTo evaluate the change in ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous from baseline to week W55; \nTo evaluate the change in other signs including vessel leakage, from baseline to week W55; \nTo evaluate the presence of macular edema from baseline to week W55;\nTo evaluate the quality of life related to uveitis, from inclusion to W55;\nTo evaluate steroid sparing effect from baseline to W55; \nTo evaluate the number and time to relapse of uveitis; and the characteristics of uveitis at worsening from baseline to W55; \nTo evaluate the effect on underlying systemic disease when appropriate from baseline to W55;\nTo evaluate the safety of adalimumab and mycophenolate mofetil (up to W55;\nSecondary Endpoints, \nTime to treatment failure up to W55; \nlogMAR BCVA in each eye, at W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55;\nAnterior chamber cell grade in each at W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55;\nVitreous haze grade (SUN criteria) in each eye at W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55;\nCentral retinal thickness in each eye from baseline at W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55; \nProportion of patients with central macular thickness< 300 microns at W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55; \nTime to optical coherence tomographic (OCT) evidence of macular edema in at least one eye, up to W55; \nNEI Visual Functioning Questionaire-25 (VFQ-25) composite score, at W12, W24, and W36; \nMeasures of corticosteroid sparing (e.g., percent meeting targets [<0.1 mg/kg/day prednisone], mean change, mean dose at week 55, and cumulative dose); \nCumulative incidence of relapse and number of relapses up to W55; \nOther clinical manifestations of underlying disease (depending on the underlying disease) will be evaluated up to W55 \nSafety and tolerability of treatments as assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events and treatment discontinuation from baseline to Week 55\nDesign of the study: This is a prospective phase III clinical trial, multicenter, open-label, two-arm randomized (1:1) clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adalimumab and standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) in subjects with recently active intermediate posterior uveitis or pan-uveitis despite steroid use [i.e oral prednisone > 7 mg/day (or equivalent)].  \nOral corticosteroids should be at a stable dose at least 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0.\nCategory: Cat 2\nPopulation of study participants: Adult patients with recently active Non-infectious Uveitis (NIU) despite oral prednisone > 7 mg/day ()\n\nRecently active disease: defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following parameters in either eye within the 3 months prior to inclusion visit:\nActive chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesion \nPresence of macular edema by optical coherence. \n≥  2+ anterior chamber cells (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature [SUN] criteria) \n≥  2+ vitreous haze (National Eye Institute [NEI]/SUN criteria);\nInclusion criteria: The eligibility criteria will be checked at the screening visit (which takes place four weeks maximum prior to inclusion visit) and at the inclusion/randomization visit.

All patients with NIU will receive oral prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day (or oral corticosteroid equivalent) with a maximum of 35 mg/day of prednisone or . \nA common prednisone-tapering programme will be applied to both groups with a decrease until discontinuation between week 13 and week 19, as long as the disease is inactive.\nComparator treatment: Arm 2: Standard of care defined by Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day orally for 36 weeks\nInterventions added for the study: - Adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously) \n- Visit at week 4, 8, 16, 20 and 30 weeks\n- HCG plasmatic or urine pregnancy test at inclusion, and urine pregnancy test at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36 and 55 weeks, and monthly until 6 weeks after stopping Mycophenolate mofetil therapy, and until 5 months after stopping Adalimumab therapy, unless menopause or sterility is confirmed.\n- Fundoscopy, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at 4, 8, 16, 20 and 30 weeks\n- Retinal angiography at 36 weeks\n- QOL questionnaires at D0, W12, W24 and 36 weeks\nExpected benefits for the participants and for society: Refractory non-infectious uveitis is a serious ocular pathology, accounting for 10-15% of total blindness cases. Reliable clinical data are required for the treatment of uveitis and more particularly in the use of biotherapies. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have shown a sustained remission rate of 70% in severe refractory/relapsing uveitis. The incidence of blindness in UNI has been reduced in recent years with the use of biotherapies, raising the question of whether these therapies should be prescribed earlier in the management of patients with severe non-infectious uveitis. Compared to conventional immunosuppressants, biotherapies are fast acting and highly effective in corticosteroids sparing, thus limiting the risk of cataract and/or cortico-induced glaucoma. FOCUS is the first randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adalimumab to standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) in the maintenance treatment of corticosteroid-dependent UNI. This study will validate and optimize the treatment of hard-to-treat patients with uveitis. It may also confirm whether or not adalimumab is superior to mycophenolate mofetil in terms of efficacy. It will allow a direct comparison of the safety profiles of these treatments. It could significantly improve the management of patients with corticosteroid-dependent UNI and finally help in the selection of the best treatment to prevent the onset of blindness and side effects in these difficult to treat cases. The expected benefit is both individual, by reducing morbidity for patients with non-infectious uveitis, and collective, by reducing the costs of unemployment, disability and hospitalization caused by UNI.\nRisks and burdens added by the study: Risks associated with the toxicities of the investigational drugs \nRisks associated with use of concomitant medication\nThe risk level of the study :  Risk C\nPractical implementation: After the collection of their free and informed consent, eligible patients will be randomized into one of 2 groups at the randomization visit (D0)\nArm 1: Adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously)\nArm 2: Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day orally for 36 weeks \nAll patients will receive the same corticosteroid regimen at inclusion. All patients will receive corticosteroids (10-35 mg/day) at inclusion.\nThe following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups with a decrease until discontinuation between week 13 and week 19 as long as the disease is inactive:\nNumber of participants included: 120 patients (60 in each arms)\nNumber of centres: Multicenter national study including 27 centers (26 recruitment centres)\nDuration of the study: Duration of inclusions: 30 months\nDuration of participation of each patient: 13 months and 3 weeks (55 weeks)\nTotal duration of the study: 44 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.15 patient/month/center\nStatistical analysis: This is a prospective, two-arm randomized, open-label, phase III trial comparing Adalimumab to Standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) based on a binary primary endpoint (treatment failure at week 36 of treatment). Randomization will be stratified on  macular oedema, and steroid dose at inclusion. This trial will be conducted using a group sequential design with one interim analysis after 50% of primary observations have been completed, with efficacy and futility early stopping rules. \nSpecifically, assuming a probability of treatment failure (primary endpoint) of 50% in the SoC control population versus 20% under the alternative hypothesis with adalimumab, a total number of 106 patients (53 per randomization arm) is required to ensure 90% power with a 2.5% one-sided type I error risk, accounting for one interim analysis after 50% of primary observations have been completed and using Lan & DeMets O’Brien & Fleming-type risk-spending functions to define efficacy and futility (non-binding) early stopping rules. Moreover, we plan to include a total of 120 patients (60 per randomization arm) to account for potential 10% of lost-to-follow-up.\nFunding sources: PHRC 2020\nStudy will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board: Yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab and the immunosuppressant (mycophenolate mofetil) in subjects with non-infectious uveitis with steroid dependency. Uveitis is a term referring to inflammation affecting structures in the eye including the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. The inflammation may affect only one eye structure or multiple structures. In many cases, both eyes are involved and symptoms may include decreased vision, eye pain, ocular redness, tearing, photophobia (pain and/or sensitivity to light), elevated intraocular pressure, intraocular scarring, macular edema, and even vascular occlusion. The International Uveitis Study Group (IUSG) has classified uveitis into four major categories based on the anatomic location of the inflammation: anterior (iris and ciliary body), intermediate (peripheral retina and pars plana of the ciliary body), posterior (choroid and retina), and panuveitis. The IUSG anatomic classification scheme was endorsed by the First International Workshop on Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) held in 2004 in the US1. In 2008, the IUSG updated this classification system to include etiological criteria2. The updated classification includes three main categories of uveitis: infectious, non-infectious (including idiopathic/unknown etiology, as well as systemic autoimmune disorders), and masquerade syndromes (neoplastic, drug induced). FOCUS is the first prospective randomized, head-to-head study, comparing Adalimumab to immunosuppressant (Mycophenolate mofetil) in non-infectious uveitis (NIU) with steroids dependency. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic or immunosuppressive agent in NIU with steroids dependency to maintain remission. NIU can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal blindness.3 The incidence of blindness in NIU has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of efficient immunosuppressive treatments or biologics, raising the question of which treatments (immunosuppressants such as Mycophenolate mofetil or biologics such as adalimumab) are the most efficient in steroid dependent active NIU. Despite a strong rationale, the place of each compound is not yet well defined in the strategy to maintain remission in uveitis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study. In this study we will be able to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of these different drugs (immunosuppressants and biologic agents) in the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan- uveitis with steroid dependency.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Eligible patients with active and refractory NIU will randomized at 1:1 ratio after they have given free and informed consent between: Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously) Arm 2: standard of care: Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day orally for 36 weeks All treatment arms will receive the same corticosteroid regimen at inclusion. At randomization (Day 0), patients receive treatment allocated by randomization. The schedule of reduction of prednisone presented above (table 1) will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive. All patients will be followed at week W4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55. Patients with uncontrolled, worsening and/or flare of uveitis at any time of the study will be considered as non-responders, and will be treated according to the best standard of care by their physician. This is a prospective phase III, multicenter, Bayesian, multi-arm multi-stage, randomized (1:1), clinical trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of Adalimumab to standard of care ( mycophenolate mofetil) in subjects with recently active non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis despite steroids use (oral prednisone > 7 mg/day ). For the purposes of this study, recently active Non-infectious Uveitis (NIU) is defined by the presence of at least 1 of the following parameters in either eye within the 3 months prior to inclusion visit: - Active chorioretinal or retinal vascular lesion - Presence of macular edema by optical coherence. - ≥ 2+ anterior chamber cells (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature [SUN] criteria) - ≥ 2+ vitreous haze (National Eye Institute [NEI]/SUN criteria); The activity status (recently active disease) has to be confirmed for all patients before the randomization by ophtalmologic assessments. All patients will be followed at week 4, W8, W12, W16, W20, W24, W30, W36 and W55. Patients with uncontrolled, worsening and/or flare of uveitis at any time of the study will be considered as non responders and will be treated at the discretion of their physician according to the best standard of care. The final visit will be at week 55. The design is an open-label two-arm randomized clinical trial owing to the different frequency of administration of the 2 compared treatments. We will use a group sequential design, with one interim analysis after 50% of primary observations have been completed, with efficacy and futility (non-binding) stopping rules. Lan&DeMets risk-spending functions will be used to define stopping boundaries (O’Brien&Fleming-like boundaries). Randomization will be stratified by macular oedema, and steroid dose at the time of inclusion (<20mg/d vs. ≥ 20mg/d). At randomization, the patient may be under treatment with prednisone as single therapy (10- 35 mg/day). All systemic immunosuppressants must have been discontinued prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0. Day -30 to Day 0: Eligibility for enrollment is determined. Day 0: Inclusion and randomization in a 1:1 ratio will be stratified by macular oedema and steroid dose at inclusion between 2 arms: Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg at day 0, then 40mg/14 days from W1 to W35 subcutaneously) Arm 2: Standard of care: Mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/day orally for 36 weeks Oral corticosteroids should be at a stable dose at least 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0. All patients will receive the same corticosteroid regimen at inclusion that is 10-35 mg/day at inclusion. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups (discontinuation between W13 and W19) as long as the disease is inactive: Table 1: schedule of prednisone reduction Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30: Evaluation of secondary assessment criteria Week 36: Evaluation of primary and secondary assessment criteria Patients with uncontrolled, worsening and/or flare of uveitis at any time of the study will be considered as non responders and will be treated at the discretion of their physician according to the best standard of care. The final visit will be at week 55. Additional visits will take place in case of any clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of a flare-up of the disease. The point of time for the primary analysis is at week 36. Given the expected recurrence rate of the disease in the different treatment groups, 36 weeks is considered a sufficient period of time to do a statistically adequate comparison between the three medications as usually required in study relative to treatment of uveitis. Figure 2: Scheme of the study This national multicenters study, involving at least 27 clinical centers. Participating centers will be Internal medicine, or rheumatology, CIC, CRC and Opthalmology departments of public hospitals located in France. Visits of Selection and Follow-up will be conducted by investigators of internal medicine or rheumatology and ophtalomology centers. Patient’s inclusion and randomization (D0) will be performed by an investigator of internal medicine center or rheumatology. Recruitment centres Internal medicine, or rheumatology departments of public hospitals located in France. Non-recruitment centres CIC, CRC and Opthalmology departments of public hospitals located in France. The dynamism of the French national reference center for inflammatory ocular diseases and the French uveitis network, both of which sharing a strong experience as investigation centers for clinical studies regarding the treatment of inflammatory ocular conditions, together with the expected level of recruitment by these centers ensure the feasibility of this study. The French uveitis network (GMIO - Groupe français d’étude des Maladies Inflammatoires de l’Œil) conducted a recent study that evaluated the efficiency of anti-TNF therapy in NIU and recruited 250 patients in 1 year. We have enrolled more than 100 patients in a controlled randomized study in NIU (PHRC RUBI). Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant after the premature discontinuation of treatment for  the duration of participation according to the research schedule. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr ) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. Since a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. If, during the course of his/her participation in the study, the participant presents one of the following exclusion criteria, then the study product/ must be discontinued but the participant will continue to be monitored for the study. A subject must permanently discontinue the study treatment for any of the following criteria,: Pregnancy. During the study: Active tuberculosis TB, or positive IGRA results indicating latent TB and absence of compliance to a prophylactic TB treatment. Serious allergic (≥ grade 3) reaction to the study drug including anaphylactic reactions. Stevens Johnson syndrome. Increase of ALT and/or AST>  grade 3 Disease flare or worsening of ocular inflammation requiring another immunosuppressant and/or immunomodulator. Interruption of treatment > 30 days. Serious infections (grade > 3) . Anemia grade > 3, neutropenia grade >3, thrombocytopenia grade > 3 Malignancy other than in situ cervix carcinoma, or adequately treated non-metastatic squamous cell or basal cell skin carcinoma. Multiple sclerosis or any other demyelinating disorder. HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis (B or C) diagnosed during the study period. Consent withdrawal. Any condition that would place the subject at risk in case of treatment continuation. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up If a patient's consent is withdrawn, the data collected prior to the withdrawal will be used, except if the patient does not allow investigators to use the already collected data. If the study is still in the inclusion period and if the withdrawn implies that the primary outcome could not be analysed, a new patient will be included, otherwise all patients included will be analysed and not replaced (Intention to treat Analysis). The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.

To demonstrate that the prevalence is two-fold that observed in non-responders, with a type I error at 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, the sample size is tabulated below according to the prevalence of response.\nThus, to anticipate for potential large disproportion in responders/non responders (that will be only defined after study inclusion) we decided to include 205 patients. This will allow to control for type I and type II error rates in the comparison of the prevalence of CYP2C19 UM profile among these groups. In addition the sample size will allow to study sufficient numbers of CYP2D6 PM, IM, and UM to determine the effects of CYP2D6 variations on V and ODV plasma levels and their efficacy or risk of adverse events.\nThe type I error rate will be fixed at 0.05. All tests will be two-sided and compared thus to 0.05.\nMultiple imputations, which are a popular approach for handling the pervasive problem of missing data in biostatistics, will be used. It is usually performed under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. Multiple imputations by chained equation are to our knowledge the most flexible approach to handle complex patterns of missing data (including categorical data, quantitative data, and survival data).\nPrimary analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nSecondary exploratory analyses will consider the population of compliers, that is, those who completed the treatment according to the scheduled protocol.\nFunding source: PHRC AOM 14562\nand for dosages for the determination of phenotypes: Department of pharmacology-toxicology, Geneva\nData Safety Monitoring Board anticipated: Non",

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Phase III study comparing GVHD prophylaxis with ATG-thymoglobulin to ATLG-grafalon in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplatic syndrome and receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a 10/10 HLA matched unrelated donor following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen by fludarabine-treosulfan\nAcronym/reference: OPTISAGE / APHP230276 / EU CT n°2023-504555-27-00\nCoordinating investigator: Pr Régis Peffault de Latour\nBMT department    \nHôpital Saint Louis, avenue Vellefaux, 75010 Paris\nEmail : regis.peffaultdelatour@aphp.fr\nScientific Director: Pr Marie Thérèse RUBIO\nHematology department\nCHRU Nancy, Hôpital Brabois, Allée du Morvan \n54500 Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France \nEmail : m.rubio@chru-nancy.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Most of the patients requiring an allo-HSCT are above 50 years of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. The optimal RIC and GVHD prophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the disease while preventing GVHD remains to be determined for elderly patients. A phase III trial comparing the conventional RIC fludarabine-busulfan 2 days to fludarabine-treosulfan demonstrated an advantage for the flu-treosulfan arm in terms of event free survival (EFS), that should therefore be considered as the new standard of RIC regimen for AML and MDS. GVHD prevention has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes by potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and immune reconstitution. Anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) are recommended to reduce the risk of acute and chronic GVHD in transplants performed with matched unrelated donors. However, the optimal type of ATG between the 2 approved brands (ATG-thymoglobulin and ATLG-grafalon) displaying distinct characteristics and the optimal dose of ATG are still unknown. In a retrospective study of patients transplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and unrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we observed that ATLG was associated with a reduction of grade II-IV acute GVHD in comparison to ATG without increasing the incidence of relapse. \nIn this phase III randomized study, we propose to compare GVHD prevention with ATG versus ATLG in AML and MDS patients above 50 years of age transplanted with a matched unrelated donor following a fludarabine-treosulfan RIC, with the hypothesis that ATLG would better control GVHD in this population of patients thus limiting the risk of morbidity and mortality of the procedure.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: to compare the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD at day 100 post-transplantation in MDS or AML patients transplanted with a 10/10 matched unrelated donor (MUD) following a reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine-treosulfan between patients receiving a GVHD prophylaxis with ATG-thymoglobulin versus ATLG-grafalon. \n\nPrimary endpoint\nIncidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD according to the MAGIC classification (Appendix 19.9 Section 1) at day 100 post-transplantation.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives: \nTo evaluate the effect of the 2 GVHD prophylaxis on the engraftment and graft failure, \nTo evaluate the effect of the 2 GVHD prophylaxis on the incidence of grade I acute GVHD and of chronic GvHD, \nTo evaluate the effect of the 2 GVHD prophylaxis on incidence of infections\nTo evaluate the effect of the 2 GVHD

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Most of the patients requiring an allo-HSCT are above 50 years of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Older recipient age is also associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), a major complication of allo-HSCT, responsible for a high morbidity and a probability of mortality of about 20% in this population of patients. In addition, disease relapse after transplantation with RIC occurs in more than 30% of patients transplanted for AML or MDS Thus, the probability of event free survival (EFS), in patients transplanted for AML or MDS with a matched unrelated or related donor above 50 years of age is between 40 and 50% at 2 years and needs to be improved [1, 2]. The optimal conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the disease while preventing GVHD remains to be determined for elderly patients. The most frequently RIC regimen used in France is fludarabine-busulfan 6.4 mg/kg (Flu-Bu2). A phase III trial comparing Flu-Bu2 to Fludarabine-Treosulfan reported an improved 2-year EFS with fludarabine-treosulfan, mainly because of a reduction of transplant related mortality [3]. Thus, fludarabine-treosulfan should be considered as the new standard of RIC regimen for AML and MDS. The prevention of GVHD has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes by potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, immune reconstitution, and the risk of fatal infections. Anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) are recommended to reduce the risk of acute and chronic GVHD in transplants performed with matched unrelated donors [4]. However, the optimal type of ATG between the 2 approved brands (ATG-thymoglobulin and ATLG-grafalon) displaying distinct characteristics and the optimal dose of ATG are still unknown after RIC regimen because of a potential induction of a higher relapse risk [4]. In a retrospective study of patients transplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and unrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we observed that ATLG was associated with a reduction of grade II-IV acute GVHD in comparison to ATG without increasing the incidence of relapse, leading to improved severe GVHD and relapse free survival (GRFS) in the ATLG group [5]. In this phase III randomized study, we propose to compare GVHD prevention with ATG versus ATLG in AML and MDS patients above 50 years of age transplanted with a matched unrelated donor following a fludarabine-treosulfan RIC, with the hypothesis that ATLG would better control GVHD in this population of patients thus limiting the risk of morbidity and mortality of the procedure.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Grafalon: the SmPC will be followed. Thymoglobuline: According to the SmPC, in case of prevention of GVHD, it is recommended to use 2.5mg/kg/day from day -4 to day -2 or -1 resulting in a cumulative dose of 7,5 to 10 mg/kg. In this study, ATG-thymo will be used following two possible schedules of administration, depending on the investigator’s usual practice, the cumulative dose being 5mg/kg for both schedule: either at 2,5 mg/kg/day from day -3 to day -2 or at 0.5mg/kg at day -4, then 2mg/kg at day -3, then 2.5mg/kg at day -2. As described in previous sections of this protocol, several studies have tried to identify the optimal dose of ATG-thymo with a reduced conditioning, by comparing doses ranging from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg (Crocchiolo, 2013)(Devillier, 2013)(Remberger, 2013)(Butera, 2021). They have showed that the dose of 2.5 mg/kg was inefficacious to reduce the risk of GVHD and that doses above 6 mg/kg were associated with a higher risk of flare and mortality due to infections. These results were confirmed by an American study showing that the probability of survival without flare and without severe GVHD was higher with a dose of 4.5 mg/kg than with 7.5 mg/kg in patients transplanted for an acute myeloid leukemia with an unmatched 10/10 HLA donor and attenuated conditioning (Bashir, 2012). Based on these studies, the recommended dose of ATG-thymo with a reduced or attenuated conditioning for HLA 10/10 donor is 4.5 to 6 mg/kg (Baron, 2017) and the dose used in France is 5 mg/kg. The second scheme (increasing doses) has been proposed to reduce the intensity of the immune-allergic reaction responsible for fever, skin reaction and potentially blood pressure drop, a frequent side effect mainly observed during the first infusion of ATG (4). Both administration schedules have shown to prevent the occurrence of graft versus host disease (2, 3). In addition, it is known from pharmacokinetic studies that the clearance of ATG takes several weeks suggesting that the administration of a first 10% of the total dose will not dramatically change the pharmacokinetic of the drug elimination (5). The administration of the 5 mg/kg total dose ATG is frequently split in 3 days in many centers. We therefore would allow the possibility to use this second schedule in the study. Phase III multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label trial, comparing with 2 parallel-groups in a homogeneous population of patients (AML or MDS, age 50-70, fludarabine-treosulfan conditioning): ATG-thymoglobulin versus ATLG-grafalon. Participants distributed between groups at a ratio of 1:1 (1 ATG-thymoglobulin / 1 ATLG-grafalon) This is a national multi-center study including 26 adults transplant centres of the SFGM-TC. - Recruitment centres Patients will be recruited in the hematology units and referred to the transplant team for the pre-transplant assessment. At this visit, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified. The consent of the patient will be collected at the latest by D-9 before HSCT. A Patient Information Sheet and consent form are given to the patient by the investigator. The investigator will keep the original, a copy is given to the patient and a third copy is kept for the Sponsor. Then, patients are randomized on eCRF CleanWeb for receiving prophylaxis of GvHD with ATG-thymoglobulin or ATLG-grafalon. Baseline visit also consists in physical examination, biological testing and imagery. This assessment is performed according to the practice of the investigator. The patient assessment is performed in the usual care of allogeneic transplant. • Physical examination - Reports of patient and disease history - ECOG performans status assessment - Sorror score of comorbidities - Complete physical examination with evaluation of tumor localization -Electrocardiogram - Echocardiogram with evaluation of left ventricular ejection - Pulmonary function tests including at least Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC) - Liver ultrasound and doppler echography (baseline values) • Disease assessment: Pre-transplant bone marrow aspiration and disease evaluation • Biological tests - Complete Blood count - Prothrombin time (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) - ABO and Rh typing Blood cell - Chemistry panel (serum electrolytes with creatinine, calcium, glucose, uric acid, magnesium levels, ferritin, CRP) - Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT and bilirubine) - Circulating protein electrophoresis - HLA compatibility check between recipient and donor - Chimerism markers’ identification - Viral serologies: Serology for hepatitis B and C, Aspergillus antigen, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV (2 Elisa tests), HTLV-1 and 2, toxoplasmosis (IgG and M), TPHA and VDRL - -HCG for women of childbearing potential • Imaging - Dental radiography - sinus, thorax and abdominal CT scan • Health-related Quality of life: FACT-BMT-v4 questionnaire The protocol is carried out by the Société Francophone de Greffe de Moëlle et de Thérapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC). The majority of the adult centers of SFGM-TC accepted to participate to this research (26 sites). The interest of the trial has been validated by the French scientific council of the SFGM-TC. In the last 3 years, SFGM-TC registry reported about 200 patients per year eligible for this trial, which illustrate the feasibility of the study. The patients will be recruited during a standard of care visit at the hospital. Each involved centre expects to enrol 2 to 12 patients/year (380 expected/324 required) Justification of sufficient recruitment capacity for the number of participants that need to be included: Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Regarding Experimental Treatments (ATG and ATLG) all patients will receive a premedication based on paracetamol, corticoids and anti-histaminic. In case of occurrence of immunological reactions, including shock, Cytokine Release Syndrome, the treatment will be immediately stopped (according to SmPC); once patient conditions have improved, premedication will be administrated again and the treatment will be readministered, as scheduled. Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant until the serious adverse event is resolved. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. If a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Elderly patients (Age ≥ 50 and ≤ 70 years) with AML or high risk MDS receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a 10/10 HLA matched unrelated donor. The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.

Data will be analyzed according to pre-conditioning lymphocyte counts and correlated to post-transplant outcomes (GVHD, relapse, NRM) to be able to determine of a formula to optimize ATLG dose to lymphocyte counts for future studies. This plasma collection will start including patients after finding complementary funding. Bio collection of PBMC, plasma and dry pellets from total blood cells will be performed on D-9 (base line), D14, 21, 28, 56, 100, M6 and M12 in 60 patients per arm for future biological studies that would be performed after finding complementary funding. The collections will be organized via Cryostem (https://www.cryostem.org/). Biocollection will allow to perform comparative immunological studies between the two arms to explain the different effects of both ATG on the control of alloreactivity (immune reconstitution, cytokine levels, broad immune cell transcriptomic patterns, T cell repertoire …). Immune modulation by multiparameter flow cytometry analyses of T cell subtypes and activation/exhaustion phenotype, monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, T cell repertoire reconstitution and single cell transcriptomic analyses of different immune cell subtypes (monocytes, DCs, T, B and NK cells, regulatory T cells, iNKT, MDSCs) at early time points after allo-HSCT (D-9 (base line), D14, D21, D28, D56, D100) would be of interest to better understand the modulation of the immune response between the two ATG brands.",

Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be used to summarize categorical endpoints. Disposition of the Study Subjects: The disposition of subjects will be described with summaries by treatment group of the number of subjects enrolled, the number of subjects treated, and the number of subjects for whom study drug was permanently discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation). Demographic and Baseline Characteristics: Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group and overall.. Primary endpoint: Incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD according to the MAGIC classification (Appendix 19.9 section 1) at day 100 post-transplantation. Primary analysis will test differences of incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD will be tested using Gray test (Gray RJ (1988) A class of K-sample tests for comparing the cumulative incidence of a competing risk,  Annals of Statistics, 16:1141-1154.). This test is a rank based test, extendingthe logrank test in presence of competing risks. Measure of treatment effect will be based on the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) from the Fine and Gray model. Secondary analyses will used the cause-specific hazard ratio (cHR) estimated from the Cox model as the measure of treatment effect. Secondary endpoints: Differences of incidence of Hematopoietic recoveries will be tested using the Gray test.

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Haplo-identical transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis A phase 2 prospective multicentric  study\nAcronym: FIBRAPLO\nCoordinating Investigator: Dr Marie Robin\nHôpital Saint-Louis, APHP, Paris\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: The only curative treatment in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT). It has been reported that intermediate and higher risk patients according to international prognostic scores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival (Kröger et al, 2015). In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective trial testing the use of ruxolitinib before transplantation (“JAK-ALLO study” NCT01795677). Outcome of patients was better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling donor than an unrelated donor confirming other studies (Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO trial, acute GVHD incidence was high, often hyperacute and severe. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a registry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation (haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of cases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which favorably compared to outcome after unrelated transplantation. Genova team has also reported impressive results after haplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et al, 2015). Bregante et al have reported outcome of 2 cohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the more frequent use of haplo in the second period (54% versus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second period with OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest that this improvement is related to the best outcome among haplo transplantation. The improvement of outcome after haplo has been attributed to a better GVHD prophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after unrelated transplantation and especially in HLA mismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in family haplo identical transplantation, this current study proposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in myelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is disease-free survival and without rejection one year after haplo-identical transplantation in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis.\nThe main criteria of judgement is disease- and rejection-free survival 12 months after HSCT.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: To assess \n-incidence of acute GVHD grade 2/4 at 100 days\n-incidence of acute GVHD grade 3 or 4 at 100 days\n-engraftment at 100 days\n-incidence of chronic GVHD at 12 months\n-non-relapse mortality at 12 months\n-overall survival at 12 months\n-relapse/progression incidence at 12 months\n-rejection incidence at 12 months\n-time to neutrophil engraftment at 100 days\n-time to platelet engraftment at 100 days\n-infection incidence at 100 days and at 12 months\n-cytokine profile during transplantation (day-7+/- 1 day , day 0 and day 7+/- 1 day )\n-impact of genetic alterations on overall survival at 12 months and non-relapse morality at 12 months\nDesign of the trial: This a phase 2 multicentric study\nPopulation of trial subjects: Patients with a myelofibrosis who have no contraindication to transplant and who have an advanced disease by international scores could be proposed to the trial if they do not have an HLA-matched donor.\nInclusion criteria: Patients aged between 18 and 70 years \nPrimary myelofibrosis or myelofibrosis secondary to essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia Vera proven by marrow biopsy\nThe myelofibrosis should combine at least 2 of the       following criteria:\nconstitutional symptoms: weight loss > 10% in one year, fever (without infection), recurrent muscle, bone or join pains, extreme fatigue\nanemia with hemoglobin < 10 gr/dL or red blood cell transfusion requirement\nthrombocytopenia < 100 G/L\nperipheral blast count > 1% at least found 2 times\nwhite blood cell count > 25 G/L (before a cytoreductive treatment)\nKaryotype: +8, -7/7q-, i(17q), -5, 5q-, 12p-, inv(3), 11q23\nPerformance status according to ECOG at 0, 1 or 2\nWith health insurance coverage\nHaving signed a written informed consent\nWomen agreed to take nomegestrol acetate as contraception during and up to 6 months after treatment by treosulfan\nMen agreed not to conceive child during and up to 6 months after treatment by treosulfan\nExclusion criteria: Myelofibrosis transformed into acute leukemia \nPoor performance status with ECOG 3 or more\nCardiac failure with EF < or = 50% currently or in the past (even if corrected after treatment)\nRenal failure with creatininemia > 130 µmol/L or clearance < 50ml/min\nRespiratory function altered with vital capacity < 70% or forced expired volume < 70%\nBiological significant liver abnormalities;

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis The only curative treatment in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT). Many registry studies have reported outcome after transplantation with disease-free survival from 30 to 70% according to risk factors related to the patient, the disease and the type of transplantation (Kröger et al, 2009; Ballen et al, 2010; Deeg et al, 2003; Ditschkowski et al, 2012; Robin et al, 2011; Patriarca et al, 2008). Long-term outcome after HSCT has also reported minimal mortality after 2 years post-transplant, especially in younger patients (Robin et al, 2019). HSCT in patients with myelofibrosis has some specificities because patients usually have not received any chemotherapy before transplantation, they are transplanted with an uncontrolled disease exposing the patient to tumour lysis syndrome (5 to 10%) and no engraftment (5 to 10%). Secondary pancytopenia are also frequent after HSCT, usually transient (Alchalby et al, 2016). Furthermore, the management of their usual splenomegaly is still a matter of debate. Splenectomy has been reported as increasing relapse risk in one prospective trial but it was not confirmed by other study(Kröger et al, 2009). 10 to 40% of patients who received HSCT underwent a splenectomy, this proportion will possibly be lower using ruxolitinib before transplantation. Previous thrombosis, chronic hepatic disease as well as cardiac pulmonary hypertension are relatively frequent in these patients and should be taken into account when performing HSCT (Iurlo et al, 2015; Brabrand et al, 2019; Sciumè et al, 2017; Barraco et al, 2017; Tremblay et al, 2019). It has been reported that intermediate and higher risk patients according to international prognostic scores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival (Kröger et al, 2015). International recommendations from experts, confirm that HSCT should be performed in patients with higher risk and should be discussed in young patients who are at lower risk (intermediate-1). In 2013, we initiated in France a prospective trial testing the use of ruxolitinib before HSCT in patients with myelofibrosis (JAK-ALLO study NCT01795677). Outcome of patients was better in patients with a matched sibling donor than with an unrelated donor confirming previous prospective studies (Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014; Gupta et al, 2019). In the JAK-ALLO trial, acute GVHD incidence was high (#70%), often hyperacute (#33%) and severe (grade 3-4 #44%). The majority of acute GVHD occurring after 9/10 HLA mismatched unrelated transplantation was grade 3-4 acute GVHD and mortality was in consequence high with disease-free survival at 1 year at 34% (compared 82% after HLA matched sibling donor). Haplo-identical transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis Haplo-identical transplantation has considerably progressed in the last years with better results and most frequent utilization in all countries. The use of post-transplant cyclosphosphamid has been reported safe and efficient to prevent GVHD without impairing engraftment (Luznik et al, 2012; Bashey et al, 2013; Raj et al, 2014). The majority of data concerns either acute leukemia or various diseases. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a registry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation (haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of cases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which compared favourably to outcome after unrelated transplantation. Genova team has also reported impressive results after haplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et al, 2015). Bregante et al has reported outcome of 2 cohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the more frequent use of haplo in the second period (54% versus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second period with OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest that this improvement is related to the best outcome among haplo transplantation. The improvement of outcome after haplo has been attributed to a better GVHD prophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after unrelated transplantation and especially in HLA mismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in family haplo identical transplantation, this current study proposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in myelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor. The hypothesis is that haplo-identical transplantation in patients with myelofibrosis gives better results (disease-free and rejection-free survival) that a transplantation from an HLA mismatched unrelated donor. We expect a disease- and rejection-free survival at one year at 55% with haplo as comparison to 30% in 9/10 mismatched unrelated donor.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Treosulfan will be administered in intravenous over 2 hours 3 consecutive days at dose currently recommended in other countries (10 gr/m2 on day -4, day -3 and day -2) before transplantation. Intravenous administration should be performed using a safe technique to avoid extravasation. The body surface is calculated according to the Mosteller's formula: S= (taille*poids/3600)0,5 This a phase 2 one-group multicenter study. This is a national multi-center study including 22 centers. Patients will be recruited in the hematology units. The baseline visit takes place 30 to 14 days before transplantation. At this visit, the consent of the patient will be collected. A Patient Information Sheet and consent form are given to the patient by the investigator; the original is conserved by the investigator and the third copy for the sponsor. Physical examination - Reports of patient and disease history (cf Annexe) (Sorror et al, 2005) - ECOG assessment (cf Annexe) (Oken et al, 1982) - Sorror score of comorbidities (cf Annexe) (Mesa et al, 2013) - Complete physical examination with evaluation of spleen size -Electrocardiogram - General symptoms associated with MF: MF-SAF form (cf Annexe) - Evaluation of the cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, HTA, obesity, smoking). Radiological examinations - Pulmonary function tests including at least Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC)“ - Liver ultrasound and doppler echography (baseline values) - Total body scan - Echocardiogram with evaluation of left ventricular ejection Biological test - Complete Blood count - Prothrombin time (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) - ABO and Rh typing Blood cell -Chemistry panel (serum electrolytes with creatinine, urea, calcium, glucose, uric acid, phosphate, CRP, proBNP, LDL, HDL, triglyceride, total cholesterol) - Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT and bilirubin) - Circulating protein electrophoresis - Pregnancy test (for women of childbearing age) - HLA compatibility check between recipient and donor - Search of anti-HLA antibodies with LUMINEX technology (DSA) - Chimerism markers’ identification - Blood karyotype (if not done previously) - Blood collection Infectious assessment - Viral serologies: Serology for hepatitis B and C, Aspergillus antigen, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV (2 Elisa tests), HTLV-1 and 2, toxoplasmosis (IgG and M), TPHA and VDRL Subjects may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a subject from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the subject's best interests. Subject lost to follow-up: the subject cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the subject (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the subject is alive or dead If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Other medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For trials which use e-CRF the investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE notification form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the initial notification and follow-up report forms for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study. The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.",

        "OBJECTIVES": "GRAALL-2014 follows the GRAALL-2003 and 2005 trials. The GRAALL-2014 trial is subdivided in three sub-studies: GRAALL-2014/B, GRAALL-2014/T and GRAAPH-2014respectively for patients with B-lineage Ph-negative ALL, T-lineage ALL or Ph+ ALL. France, Switzerland and Belgium will participate to GRAALL-2014. To prospectively validate the new risk model, based on MRD1 response level and KMT2A (=MLL) and IKZF1 gene status by comparing historical results of GRAALL-2005 with those of GRAALL-2014 in an identical population of patients (Ph- B lineage ALL, aged 18 to 59 years old). To evaluate MRD level, monitored by Ig-TCR, To evaluate cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), To evaluate RFS, CIR, NRM, and OS after censoring at SCT in first CR. The hypothesis is to demonstrate the non inferiority of DFS at 4 years by comparison to the historical group (<60%). To prospectively validate the new risk factors based on MRD1 response level and NOTCH1/FBXW7/RAS/PTEN gene status. To evaluate the efficacy of nelarabine-based consolidation and maintenance therapy in term of RFS in HR patients (ATRIALL substudy). Appreciate the toxicity of nelarabine-in consolidation, followed by allo-SCT or further consolidation and maintenance therapy, Evaluate MRD level, monitored by Ig-TCR, Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM), Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), RFS, CIR, NRM and OS after censoring at SCT in first CR.

Initial notification of pregnancy, SAE follow-up reports and any other document should be sent to the sponsor to the Vigilance department by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr)",
        "STATISTICAL": "Primary analyses of the 3 trials will be performed on the whole population of included patients, i.e. in intention to treat (ITT), independently from the treatment received, whatever the treatments received and whatever the objective of superiority or non-inferiority demonstration. In order to address non inferiority questions, confidence intervals at 95% of principal judgment criteria (DFS at 4 years for GRAALL-2014/B; percentage of major molecular response for GRAAPH-2014 AAL Ph+) will be calculated and their lower threshold compared to the margin of non-inferiority (15%) planned in each trial. For superiority questions or for secondary criteria, effect sizes will be appreciated one-shot and with a confidence interval of 95%, using statistical tests adapted to each criterion (log-rank test with non-informative data censored on the right, and Gray test in case of competition). Effects measured on censored criteria will be the ratio of instant risk functions, the effect on proportions will be measured by the relative risk and the difference between risks. These estimations will be adjusted on prognostic factors and if necessary risk-stratified (SR, HR, VHR). Besides, an interim analysis is planned on the Ph+ ALL study (GRAAPH-2014), after inclusion of the 60 first patients, on MRD2 molecular response: one-shot estimation by exact binomial confidence interval at 95% will be calculated, with a binomial test of the null hypothesis for equality of this response probability at 80%. Results will be transmitted to the ISC which will decide on a possible replacement of nilotinib by imatinib (or dasatinib) for all 4 cycles pre-transplant. Of note, this interim analysis is not investigating the comparison between treatment arms and a global adjustment of the trial population is not required. The 0.05 threshold is retained. The Ph+ ALL (GRAAPH-2014) trial is the only one planning an interim analysis after inclusion of the first 60 patients, with the objective of verifying the level of MRD2. No statistical criterion for stopping inclusions in the other 4 studies is planned. An amendment will be filed in case of modification of the initialstatistical analysis plan."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: CAMOVID: A multicenter randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camostat mesylate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection – COVID-19 in ambulatory adult patients\nAcronym/reference: CAMOVID\nCoordinating investigator: Dr David BOUTBOUL\nScientific Director: Pr Lara ZAFRANI\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as COVID-19. On the 22nd March 2020, 2920142 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 12784 deaths were reported by The World Health Organization (1). On the 31 March 2020, there were 52827 severe cases in France, including 3532 deaths. The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical. If most infections are not severe, 15% of infected patients will require hospitalization and 5% will require intensive care unit admission (2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on clinical symptoms and microbiological testing. To test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, testing centers use a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) on nasal swab in patients with productive cough. A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no controlled data supporting the use of any specific treatment (anti-viral drugs or immunomodulatory drugs), and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown (3).\nSARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through the binding of its spike (S) protein to the membranous aminopeptidase called ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Among other tissues, ACE2 expression has mainly been found on pneumocytes, enterocytes, renal tubular cells and podocytes. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires S protein priming by cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (4). In a murine model of SARS-CoV pneumonia, Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. showed that TMPRSS2-KO mice had weakened inflammatory cytokine responses and reduced lung injury than control mice (5). Hoffmann et al. found that a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, the camostat mesylate, blocked viral entry and reduce infection of human primary pneumocytes and lung cell lines by SARS-CoV-2. They also showed that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry (4). Another study performed by Bojkova et al (5) showed that camostat mesylate reduced cytopathogenic effect due to SARS-CoV-2 in human colonic cell lines. Camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that is commonly used in Japan (at a dose of 600 mg/day) and has been successfully and safely used to treat pancreatitis-associated pain (6) and post-operative reflux oesophagitis (7). Side effects that have been reported are rare at these doses (nausea, diarrhea, hypersensitivity in 0.1 to 0.5% of the cases, cytopenias in less than 0.1% and hyperkaliemia and abnormal hepatic function in less than 0.05%).\nWe hypothesize that camostat mesylate, initiated early in SARS-CoV2 infection, can reduce viral infection and viral cytopathogenic effect by blocking SARS-CoV2 entry into cells, and therefore prevent deterioration toward severe forms of COVID19.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Objective: Evaluate the efficacy of camostat mesylate in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 not requiring initial hospitalization, , in terms of hospitalization needs, up to day 21 after randomization\nPrimary endpoint:

COVID-19 ambulatory interventional study\n 9) Patients having completed a full SARS-CoV2 vaccine immunization procedure less than 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (last vaccine injection performed less than 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 diagnosis).\nInvestigational medicinal product(s): Camostat mesylate, oral administration\n600mg/day (2 x 100mg every 8 hours) for 14 days (day 1 to day 14)\nComparator treatment: Placebo tablets,\nfollowing the same schedule as investigational drug\nInterventions added for the study: Oral medication (camostat mesylate or placebo).\nExpected benefits for the participants and for society: The trial will evaluate a candidate therapeutic strategy in the context of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.\nSpecifically, the proposed treatment targets ambulatory high-risk patients newly diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19, and not requiring initial hospitalization. The strategy aims to improve short-term outcomes in ambulatory patients and prevent clinical evolution to more severe forms, requiring hospitalization. It will therefore participate in reducing hospitalization needs (quantitative and qualitative and relieving the healthcare system) and may reduce contagiosity. Moreover, it can be a useful therapeutic option for ambulatory patients, with early diagnoses, in the management of the epidemics in the upcoming months and lockdown removal.\nRisks and burdens added by the study: Additional risks are those of camostat mesylate. Known side effects are : digestive (nausea, vomiting diarrhea) and hypersensitivity < 0.5%, cytopenias <0.1%, liver abnormal function and hyperkaliemia in <0.05%\nRisk level of the study :  D\nPractical implementation: Patients will be screened from the consults of participating primary care general practitioners (GPs), 4 emergency departments (Saint Louis hospital, Bichat hospital, Mondor hospital and Argenteuil hospital), 2 hospital outpatientCOVID-19  screening center (Bichat hospital, Mondor hospital), outpatient consult of internal medicine at Saint Louis hospital and of the Sickle Cell Disease and inherited RBC genetic disorders, coordinating referral center. at Henri Mondor hospital .\nAt the initial consult, patients will be screened for eligibility, with the standard of care sampling for SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR (nasal or saliva) or antigen test. Upon positive laboratory confirmation of COVID19, after information, eligible patients who consent to participate to the trial will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: \n- Arm A: camostat mesylate 600mg (2x100mg/8h) (n=298)\n- Arm B: Placebo (2 tablets/8h) (n=298)\nPatients will be blinded to the treatment arm. \nAfter the inclusion visit, follow-up visits will be performed at 7, 14, 21 and 90 days. Follow-up visits will include a medical interview (either in person or teleconsultation) and paramedical assessment by registered nurses with vital signs measurement and biological sampling.\nAll included patients will benefit from standard of care ambulatory monitoring for COVID-19.\n\nBiological monitoring (blood sampling for serum electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes) and virological monitoring (RT-PCR on nasal swab) on day 7, 14, 21 will be performed locally, following standard practice in primary care. \nData will be collected via a web-based standardized electronic case report form. In case of hospitalization, the hospital report will be used as source for data collection by the GP.\nRandomization will be performed centrally via a web-based system, to ensure allocation concealment, with the use of pre-specified randomization lists based on permutation blocks.\nNumber of participants included: N=596 planned\nFrom the current knowledge on SARS-CoV2 infection in adults , we expect roughly 20% of newly diagnosed high-risk patients being hospitalized within 21 days (8).\nThe design initially included a planned interim analysis after one third of observations had been completed. A maximum total sample size of 536 evaluable patients (268 per treatment group) would allow 90% power to detect an absolute difference of 10% in the probability of hospitalization at day 21 between groups (e.g. reduction from 20% to 10%), using a z-test, with one-sided 2.5%-significance level for efficacy, using Lan & DeMets risk-spending functions (O’Brien & Fleming boundaries approximation), for efficacy and futility stopping rules.\nOverall, 596 patients (298 in each group) would be included to anticipate a potential 10% drop-out rate, given the ambulatory follow-up. \nHowever, due to the status of the pandemics as of fall 2021 and global use of vaccines, the scientific comittee decided to stop recruitment to eventually discontinue the trial early. The planned interim sample size has not been reached. Eventually, only a single final analysis will be performed at the 2.5% one-sided significance level, for the primary endpoints. Other endpoints will be analysed as planned.\nNumber of centres: Recruiting centers:\nEmergency department of Saint Louis Hospital, Paris\nCOVID-19 screening center at Bichat hospital\nEmergency department of Argenteuil hospital\nCentre de Santé Richerand, 75010 Paris\nEmergency department of H.

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "We hypothesize that camostat mesylate, initiated in early SARS-CoV2 infection, can reduce viral infection, viral cytopathogenic effect and viral spreading, by blocking SARS-CoV2 entry into cells, and therefore prevent deterioration toward severe forms of COVID-19 in high-risk patients.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Camostat mesylate by oral administration on empty stomach (i.e, 90 minutes before or after having a meal), 600mg/day (200mg every 8 hours) for 14 days (day 1 to day 14). Has been shown effective and safe in previous studies, and strengthened by pharmalogical data. Moreover, oral camostat given at the dose of 8 mg/kg/day was shown to be associated with decreased mortality in a SARS-CoV murine model (13). A recent publication also showed that antiviral activity may be achievable at usual doses of camostat (14). The necessity of administration on empty stomach is justified by recent pharmalogic data obtained from Ono on healthy volunteers (enclosed to this protocol after authorization from Ono).

Baseline laboratory results will also be required for inclusion: - Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by PCR (nasal or saliva), or other commercial or public health assay including antigen test in any specimen < 96 hours - Plasma level of beta hCG in women with potential childbearing. Randomization will be performed once patient has consented to participate (written informed consent). Upon inclusion, baseline biological assessments will be performed: complete blood count, chemistry and liver enzymes measurement, and baseline biobanking (20 mL blood on heparinate lithium and 5 mL on EDTA). Cytokine measurement, droplet quantification of SARS-CoV2 RNAemia (as detailed in (18)) and SARS-CoV-2 serology will also be performed. At the inclusion visit, patient’s contact information will be collected, as well as a closed one contact (personne de confiance) and his/her usual GP contact. If the patient misses D21 visit, the investigating team will try and contact the patient, and if necessary then the closed one and the GP, to retrieve information on the study endpoints and reasons for missed study visit(s).

Amazzough, 75011 Paris Office of Dr J. Marzouk, 75017 Paris Follow up visits will then be performed at one of the particpating centers (recruiting and non recruiting). Several situations are possible: Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 3 months following the premature discontinuation of treatment camostat mesylate or placebo. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. If a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. If, during the course of his/her participation in the study, the participant presents one of the following exclusion criteria, then the study product must be discontinued but the participant will continue to be monitored for the study: Negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR viral assessment at inclusion visit Pregnancy, breastfeeding Platelet count < 50 109/L Absolute neutrophil count < 0.5 109/L ASAT or ALAT > 5*ULN K+>5 mmol/L In case of COVID-19 deterioration with hospitalization, study medication should be maintained as planned as long as the patient’ clinical status allows, at discretion of the physician in charge. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Patients will not be replaced. The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs : the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "The persons responsible for the quality control of clinical studies (Article L.1121-3 of the Code de la Santé Publique [French Public Health Code]) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to the investigational medicinal products, the study, the study participants and in particular their identity and the results obtained. These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Code Pénal [French Criminal Code]). During and after the research involving human participants, all data collected concerning the participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be rendered non-identifying. Under no circumstances shall the names and addresses of the participants involved be shown. The sponsor will ensure that each participant has given written permission for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed. Data entry for data made non-identifying will be carried out on electronic media via a web browser (Cleanweb) linked to a database stored on the sponsor server.",
        "STATISTICAL": "The following analysis set will be considered: Intent-to-treat (ITT) defined as all randomized patients in the study and in their randomized group whatever the eligibility criteria and treatment received). This will refer to the primary analyses. As a general strategy, categorical efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized as counts (percent), and continuous efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using summary measures (median and interquartile range). Similarly, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categorical characteristics) Analyses by treatment group will be presented according to the treatment to which subjects were randomized (ITT). The endpoints (primary and secondary) will be mainly analysed without adjustment. Exploratory analyses will include adjustment on potential prognostic factors and description of hospitalization motives and characteristics (primary endpoint) per hospital. Planned subgroup analyses include: analyses stratified on age, on baseline use of macrolides, on vaccine immunization status (SARS-CoV2 vaccine yes/no, completed immunization (all required shots received) yes/no, type of vaccine). The primary endpoint (probability of hospitalization or death within 21 days) will be compared between groups using a one-sided z-test (2.5% significance level, see section 12.2 below). One interim analysis of the primary endpoint was initially planned to be conducted after one third of observations had been completed, with efficacy and futility decision rules, for early trial termination (see 12.2 for details). However, as of fall 2021, it was decided to resume enrolment and terminate the trial. Only one final analysis will be performed at the 2.5% one-sided significance level, on the available sample. Other endpoints will be analysed as planned. Secondary endpoints will be compared across groups using Fisher’s exact test when comparing probabilities between groups and Wilcoxon’s rank sum test when comparing quantitative endpoints. A 5% two-sided significance-level will be used for comparisons of secondary endpoints. Exploratory re-analyses on the endpoints will be conducted using Bayesian inference, incorporating external information, such as information on camostat efficacy from published trials and data across the world. The anticipated level of significance is 2.5% (one-sided), for the primary endpoint. Other comparative analyses will be performed with a two-sided 5% significance level."

        "PROCEDURE": "Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 1 month following the premature discontinuation of treatment. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. If, during the course of his/her participation in the study, the participant presents one of the following exclusion criteria, then the study product/procedure must be discontinued but the participant will continue to be monitored for the study. List the relevant criteria Pregnancy; Expected death or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments within 48 hours; Previously enrolled in this study, or in an other ineterventional study; Hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone or any of their excipients (SPC) Women of childbearing potential not using contraception Nursing women The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead. In this study vital status will be searched for in the National Registry of Deaths thanks to their family and first name and their date of birth and their place of residence. If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. In case of premature exit from the study, this will in no way affect their usual care for their condition. In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up No replacement of participants is planned in this study. Treatment will be unblinded in case of suspected unexpected Serious Adverse Event (SAE), in the situation where the clinical condition of the patient warrants knowing whether or not he/she received hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone. In practice, unblinding will be requested for any reason considered essential by the investigating physician by calling upon: - In situations requiring unblinding in an emergency : (in case of suspected unexpected Serious Adverse Event (SAE), in the situation where the clinical condition of the patient warrants knowing whether or not he/she received hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone) at the poison control centre at Fernand Widal Hospital, Telephone: +33 (0)1 40 05 48 48. - Apart from an emergency situation at the DRCI (Clinical Research and Innovation Department) to the DRCI project advisor whose contact informations are listed on the protocol cover page Verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria patient demographics, source of infection, severity of illness (SAPS II and SOFA scores) (Le Gall 1993 Vincent), pre-existing comorbidities as defined in the Charlson comorbidity index (addendum 15.4.2) (Charlson 1994), Clinical Frailty Scale (addendum 15.43) (Rockwood 2005; Bagshaw 2014; Muscedere 2017). Core temperature, vital signs, central hemodynamic data (if available) Standard laboratory data including serum and urinary electrolytes, creatinine, urea, cholesterol ,triglycerides and glucose levels, arterial lactate levels, arterial oxygen tension and hemoglobin oxygen saturation, arterial pH, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, INR, platelets count, total bilirubin levels. Microbiolology and virology, i.e. blood and any potential source of infection will be sampled for bacterial culture, nasopharyngeal, bronchial, or broncho-alveolar lavage fluid will be sampled for testing byPCR for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and any other respiratory virus Synacthen test, i.e. blood sample for cortisol measurement immediately before and 30 and 60 minutes after 250µg intravenous bolus of corticotrophin. Whole blood samples will be collected for measurements of biomarkers described in WP3 and WP4. These blood samples will be managed within WP2. Interventions: mechanical ventilation, renal replacement, vasopressors, unblinded corticosteroids, thiamine,  vitamin C, other vitamins, nutrition, intravenous fluids, blood products, anticoagulants, sedatives, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and antimicrobials), Assessment of the cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to glucocorticoids(Brown1991) in a subgroup of patients (cutaneous vasoconstrictor response to glucocorticoids stratum only). This test is noninvasive, is easily performed at the bedside and does not leave a scar. At least 12 hours before randomization, At least 12 hours before randomization, 60µl of betamethasone 0.05% cream (ie a dose of 30µg) will be applied on a skin surface of 2.33 cm of diameter (diameter of 1 euro coin) of the forearm as a single application until full absorption of the cream. 60µl corresponds to the volume necessary to cover the surface of 2.33 cm. The site is occluded under plastic and the degree of blanching assessed after 12 h. The blanching is assessed semi-quantitatively with a score of 0 = no skin blanching, 1 = skin blanching of less than 50% of the area of application, 2= blanching of more thatn 50% of the area of application, 3= blanching of the whole area of application, and 4 = blanching beyond the area of application. A photo of the forearm restricted to the test zone will be recorded for traceability. This photography, will be strictly limited to the area of the skin treated by betamethasone and will not contain any other feature of the patient (neither the face nor any other distinctive feature of the patient such as tattoos, piercings etc). The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department of the Clinical Research and Innovation Delegation (DRCI) within the APHP  or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). As this study uses an e-CRF: the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations. This research is not governed by the CNIL “Reference Method” (MR-001) because the inclusion of patients can be done in an emergency situation without  obtaining consent at the time of inclusion. In addition, and in order to recover the vital status of the patients, the collection of the name (and marital name for women), first name, date and place of birth of the patients is required to query the national database SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé) in which the vital status (living or dead) of an individual will be retrieved by queryingthe national centre of the epidemiology of deaths (Centre d’épidémiologie sur les causes de décés - Cépidc).The sponsor will obtain the authorisation of the CNIL (French Data Protection Agency) before implementing any data processing involving the data required to conduct the research",
        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "Multiple measures are in place for data quality control. These measures include: 1) on-site training of research and clinical personnel; 2) standard operating procedures to guide storage and administration of the study drug as well as processing, storage of blood samples; 3) ongoing assessment of quality metrics and periodic feedback to the clinical sites on performance with benchmarking from other sites; 4) site monitoring visits (remotely or in person); 5) ongoing review of missing data and outliers; and 6) rapid dissemination of responses to frequently asked questions via the international study website and monthly newsletter. Coordinating Centre personnel and the Principal Investigators will be available 24/7 to answer study-related questions. Potential participants will be referred to the research team by intensivists and other ICU staff. The research team will confirm eligibility and the site principal investigator and co-investigators will confirm whether the patient or other authorized persons may be approached for consent. If that is the case, the research team will obtain consent from the patient or other authorized persons or will enroll and obtain consent subsequently as per local REB recommendations under a deferred consent model. Daily data will be collected from day 1 until day 90 (or at the time of ICU discharge). At 3 and 6 months, follow-up will be achieved by telephone by the Coordinating Centre. All study outcomes will be documented on the electronic CRFs (eCRF). Each patient is assigned a unique ID that is used to index the CRF and the other study documents. An e-CRF will be developed by URC Paris Saclay Ouest using dedicated software (CleanWeb), to verify data and facilitate follow-up. It will capture data on the site by investigators or their assistants, as well as online randomization of patients. Access to the e-CRF via the Internet will be secured with a username and password, and the data flow will be encrypted using the https protocol. The data will be collected and recorded permanently and prospectively. At the end of the study, after the processing of the requests, the database will be frozen and transmitted to the statistics, according to the procedures established by the promoter. Clinical data will be captured in real time in the CRF by the URC's TEC. The persons responsible for the quality control of clinical studies (Article L.1121-3 of the Code de la Santé Publique [French Public Health Code]) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to the investigational medicinal products, the study, the study participants and in particular their identity and the results obtained. These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Code Pénal [French Criminal Code]). During and after the research involving human participants, all data collected concerning the participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be rendered non-identifying. Under no circumstances shall the names and addresses of the participants involved be shown. Only the participant’s initials will be recorded, accompanied by an encoded number specific to the study indicating the order of enrolment. The sponsor will ensure that each participant has given written permission for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed."

        "PROCEDURE": "All adverse events occurring after the inform consent form is signed (whether or not attributed to investigational product), will be reported on the CRF. Medically significant adverse events considered related to the investigational product by the investigator or the sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable. The following attributes must be assigned by the investigator: description; dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational product, and action taken. The investigator may be asked to provide follow-up information. It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an adverse event is of sufficient severity to require the subject’s removal from treatment. A subject may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable adverse event. If either of these occurs, the subject must undergo an end-of-study assessment and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable. If the subject was permanently withdrawn from the study or investigational product due to a serious adverse event, this information must be included in either the initial or follow-up Serious Adverse Event Report Form or the EOS Case Report Form. The severity of adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). All serious adverse events must be reported to the sponsor (AP-HP) within one working day of discovery or notification of the event. Initial serious adverse event information and all amendments or additions must be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report form, and faxed to the sponsor: Sponsor: AP-HP / DRCD Fax: 01 44 84 17 99 The sponsor will inform relevant Regulatory Authorities and the Ethics Committee: of all relevant information about serious unexpected adverse events suspected to be related to the study device, study procedure and use of study device that are fatal or life threatening as soon as possible, and in any case no later than seven days after knowledge of such a case. Relevant follow-up information for these cases will subsequently be submitted within an additional eight days. of all other serious unexpected events suspected to be related to the study medication as soon as possible , but within a maximum of fifteen days of first knowledge by the investigator. The clinical research assistants (CRA), representing the sponsor will perform investigating visits at intervals matching the monitoring of patients, the enrollments and the risk level attributed to the research by the sponsor. - Opening visit before enrollments, to establish the protocol and familiarization with the various stakeholders in biomedical research. - For following visits, electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) will be reviewed by the CRA according to the state of advancement of the research. The principal investigator and the other investigators agreed to receive the CRAs at regular intervals. During the visits, according to good clinical practice, the following elements will be reviewed: • Protocol and research procedures are respected, • Verification of informed consent from patients, • Review of source documents and comparison with data reported in the eCRF for accuracy, missing data, data consistency according to the DRCD rules. - Final visit: retrieval of eCRF, biomedical research documents, archiving. Outside these visits, the CRA will be at the disposal of the investigators to meet their needs for information or advice. A clinical study Technician (CST) will be recruited to assist the project in compliance with the Protocol and its circuits as well as filling of eCRF in the recruitment centers. All information required by the protocol will be provided in the eCRF and the investigator in case of missing data will give an explanation. The data must be recorded in the eCRF as soon as they are obtained both for clinical and non-clinical data.",

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial assessing the benefit of adherent invasive E.coli eradication in adult ileal and ileo-colonic Crohn disease\nAcronym: TEOREM\nCoordinating Investigator: Dr Franck Carbonnel\nGastroenterology Department\nKremlin Bicêtre Hospital,\n78, rue du général Leclerc\n94275 Le Kremlin-Bicêtre\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Current medical treatment of Crohn disease (CD) consists of immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies). These agents control symptoms of CD in most patients but their withdrawal leads to disease relapse. They are also associated with serious side effects (infections, lymphoma, cancer, liver toxicity). Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies are the most efficient but are cost prohibitive. Moreover, each year, roughly 10% of responders to anti-TNF become refractory to treatment, most often because they become tolerized to these drugs. \nFuture CD drugs are small molecules or biologics that antagonize pro-inflammatory cytokines or gut homing of lymphocytes. Yet, they have similar safety issues as the immunosuppressive agents currently in use. \nThe current therapeutic algorithm for CD does not take into account the site of inflammation or composition of intestinal microbiota. Moreover, dysregulated intestinal immunity and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines are not the only components of CD pathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E. coli specie with adhesive and invasive properties, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in ileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in 36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls\nThe role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated in several laboratories around the world and has shown that AIEC is pro-inflammatory and could play an important role in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As such, it may be an important therapeutic target. This randomized trial proposes a novel approach to the treatment of CD. It is individualized to patients colonized with AIEC who will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics that have been shown to be active against the bacteria in vitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks. We hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients who have been randomized into the experimental arm. If this trial is successful, it will be the first of its kind and will facilitate a new era of clinical research in patients with CD and concomitant infection with AIEC.\nPrimary objective and assessment criterion: The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether a 12-week treatment with Ciprofloxacin and Rifaximin is superior to placebo to obtain endoscopic remission in AIEC-colonized patients with ileal CD, with or without involvement of the caecum or the right colon. \nThe primary endpoint is the overall response at week 12, using centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies.\nOverall response is defined by segmental response in at least one segment in which the CDEIS was ≥8 at baseline, with no more than 20% increase of CDEIS in the other segment and a CDEIS<8 in this segment. \nSegmental response in the segment in which the CDEIS was ≥8 at baseline, is defined by:\n- In the case of isolated aphtoid ileitis and/or colitis: decrease ≥ 50% of lesions. \n- Otherwise, either decrease ≥ 50% of surface of ulcerations (either deep or superficial), or loss of deep ulcerations (if present at inclusion) with no more than 20% increase in superficial ulcerated surface.\nSecondary objectives and assessment criteria: The secondary objectives are:\nTo test the correlation between endoscopic remission and AIEC eradication at 12 weeks, \nTo assess the evolution of endoscopic lesions at week 12,\nTo assess the rate of clinical remission without steroids, anti-TNF, and surgery at 48 weeks, in patients whose AIEC has, or has not been eradicated, and in patients who have, or have not, reached the primary endpoint, \nTo assess the rate of biological remission, during the study,\nTo assess side effects in the experimental and placebo group. \n\nThe secondary endpoints are : \nEndoscopic remission at 12 weeks (assessed by centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies), defined by a CDEIS < 6 in all the segments \nMean variation of segmental CDEIS, at 12 weeks (centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies),\nComplete endoscopic remission at 12 weeks (centralized reading of ileocolonoscopies) defined by a CDEIS <3, in all the segments\nNo ulceration at 12 weeks,\nClinical remission as defined by CDAI<150 without steroids, anti-TNF, and resection surgery for CD at 12 and/or 48 week,\nBiological remission as defined CRP serum level ≤5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin <250 μg/g at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48,\nSide effects.\nExperimental design: This is a phase II clinical trial.

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Intestinal microbiota is composed by several billions of microbes in healthy adults. The dysregulated intestinal immunity and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines are not the only components of CD pathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E. coli specie with adhesive and invasive properties, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in ileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in 36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls. The role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated in several laboratories around the world and it has been shown that AIEC is proinflammatory and could play an important role in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As such, it may be an important therapeutic target. The research hypothesis is that antibiotics targeting AIEC (Ciprofloxacin + Rifaximin) will achieve mucosal healing in the CD patients colonized by AIEC. If the primary hypothesis is validated, this will be the first evidence that an eradication of a particular bacteria species by an antibiotic treatment can lead to remission in CD. If these results are confirmed, patients with CD who are AIEC+ will benefit from an antibiotic treatment in terms of prolonged remission without the use of immunosuppressants. Future trials will determine optimal treatment duration, biomarkers of early response, recolonization rate, and replication of our results at a larger scale. This randomized trial proposes a novel approach to the treatment of CD. It is individualized to patients colonized with AIEC who will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics that have been shown to be active against the bacteria in vitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks. We hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients who have been randomized into the experimental arm.",
        "OBJECTIVES": "The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether a 12-week treatment with Ciprofloxacin and Rifaximin is superior to placebo to obtain endoscopic remission in AIEC-colonized patients with ileal CD, with or without involvement of the caecum or the right colon. Endoscopic remission has been chosen as a primary endpoint because it is associated with improvement of CD evolution in the midterm. To test the correlation between endoscopic remission and AIEC eradication at week 12, To assess the evolution of endoscopic lesions at week 12, To assess the rate of clinical remission without steroids, anti-TNF, and surgery at 48 weeks in patients whose AIEC has or has not been eradicated and in patients who have or have not reached the primary endpoint, To assess the rate of biological remission, during the study, To assess side effects in the experimental and placebo group. Ancillary studies - Clinical characteristics of patients AIEC+ will be compared with AIEC- screened patients, - Effect of antibiotics and placebo upon fecal and mucosal microbiota will be assessed using PCR 16S at inclusion, week 12 and week 48 and will be correlated with primary and secondary endpoints of the study. This will allow to assess the effects of antibiotics upon dysbiosis and lead to a microbiota signature associated with endoscopic remission, - Search for AIEC lpf+ using PCR within stool specimens will be performed at the screening visit, week 12, and week 48. This will be aimed to correlate mucosal and fecal AIEC as well as fecal AIEC with clinical and endoscopic remission. RESEARCH PLAN",
        "METHODOLOGY": "The primary endpoint is the overall response at week 12, assessed by a panel of GETAID expert endoscopists, using centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies. For this, in each investigator centre, after anonymisation, ileocolonoscopies will be recorded on DVD, USB keys or on a dedicated internet platform. Overall response is defined by segmental response in at least one segment, in which the CDEIS was ≥8 at baseline with no more than 20% increase of CDEIS in the other segment and a CDEIS<8 in this segment. Segmental response in the segment in which the CDEIS was ≥8 at baseline, is defined by: - In the case of isolated aphtoid ileitis and/or colitis: decrease ≥ 50% of lesions. - Otherwise, either decrease ≥ 50% of surface of ulcerations (either deep or superficial), or loss of deep ulcerations (if present at inclusion) with no more than 20% increase in superficial ulcerated surface. The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) is a validated score of endoscopic severity in CD (Mary JY, Modigliani R. Gut 1989;30: 983-9). The segmental CDEIS is adapted to the patients included in the trial who have CD limited to the ileum and right colon. The preinclusion criteria (CDEIS>8) and the definition of endoscopic response and remission have been defined with JY Mary. The segmental CDEIS will be measured by an endoscopist during an ileocolonoscopy performed at the preinclusion visit and at week 12 of the treatment. During these two ileocolonoscopies, 4 ileal biopsies will be taken (2 for the AIEC search and 2 for the biological collection), at the edge of ulcerations; 2 rectal biopsies will be taken, for AIEC search. The primary endpoint is assessed at week 12 after randomization, that is, at least 18 weeks after the start of the budesonide or prednisone or prednisolone treatment, which lasts 12 weeks. Therefore, at the moment of the primary endpoint, most patients will have stopped budesonide. This will avoid any interaction between steroids (budesonide or prednisone or prednisolone) and antibiotics. The same endoscopist will perform the ileocolonoscopy at the preinclusion visit and at week 12. The ileocolonoscopies will be performed within the gastroenterology unit. The secondary endpoints are: Endoscopic remission at 12 weeks (assessed by centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies), is defined by a CDEIS < 6 in all the segments Mean variation of segmental CDEIS, at 12 weeks (assessed by centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies), Complete endoscopic remission at 12 weeks (assessed by centralized, anonymous and blinded reading of ileocolonoscopies) defined by a CDEIS <3, in all the segments No ulceration at 12 weeks, Clinical remission as defined by CDAI<150 without steroids, anti-TNF, and resection surgery for CD at 12 and/or 48 week, Biological remission as defined CRP serum level ≤5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin <250 μg/g at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48, Side effects",

Anti-TNF has been used for BD uveitis for 15 years. The incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction therapy in severe BD uveitis. BD uveitis is considered as the most devastating inflammatory ocular disease. Risk of visual loss reaches 25% at 5 years and 80% of patients have a bilateral involvement. Contrasting with immunosuppressors or interferon-alpha, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. However, anti-TNFα failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of severe sight threatening uveitis. There is little published information on use of biologics other than anti-TNF for severe BD uveitis. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. IL-6 expression correlates with BD activity and other immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with tocilizumab.

Anti-TNF is a rapidly acting agent when compared to methylprednisolone or interferon alpha in suppressing ocular inflammation. However, they failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of patients. Also, TNFa antagonists seems to have suspensive effect on ocular inflammation in BD. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. Rapid onset of action and steroid-sparing effect characterize the efficacy of tocilizumab. Nowadays, the management of severe BD still remains largely empirical. This is the first randomized, head to head, study for therapeutic management of severe uveitis in BD with biologics. This study may assess the benefit of tocilizumab comparatively to that of adalimumab in sight-threatening Behçet’s disease in terms of safety, efficacy and steroid sparing. It could thus improve the care of patients with BD and with uveitis in general. The expected benefit is both individual, in reducing morbidity and rate of blindness for young patients with BD, and collective, in reducing costs of hospitalization, and of dependence.\nRisks and burdens added by the study: Risks associated with the toxicities of the investigational drugs \nRisks associated with use of contrast medium for retinal angiography\nThe risk level of the study : Risk C\nPractical implementation: After the collection of their free and informed consent, eligible patients with active sight threatening Behçet’s disease uveitis will be randomized into one of 2 groups at the randomization visit (D0):\n• Arm A (Adalimumab) 80mg at D0 then 40 mg subcutaneously at week 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15\n• Arm B (Tocilizumab) 162mg subcutaneously every week for 15 weeks \nAll treatment groups will receive the same corticosteroid regimen. All patients will receive oral prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) at 1 mg/kg/day (up to 80 mg/day) at randomization. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive:\n• 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 80 mg/d) week D0-W4,\n• 40 mg/day W4-W6\n• 30 mg/day W6-W8, \n• 20 mg/day W8-W10, \n• 15 mg/day W10-W12, \n• 10 mg/day W12-W14, \n• 5 mg/day W14-W16,\nDose of corticosteroids will be left at the investigator discretion after W16\nNumber of participants included: 60 patients (30 patients in each arm)\nNumber of sites: Multicenter national study including 26 centers\nDuration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months\nParticipation period (treatment+follow-up): 12 months\nTotal duration: 48 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,07\nStatistical analysis: The experimental design is an open multicenter randomized clinical trial stratified on the characteristics of the initial uveitis in Behçet’s disease : retinal inflammation (retinal vascularitis and/or macular edema) and according to the diagnosis (newly diagnosed or relapsing disease), with evaluation of the primary assessment criteria at 16 weeks. \nThe primary assessment criteria will be reviewed by a scientific committee blinded of the randomization. \nThe RCT will use a Bayesian design for phase II randomized national multicenter clinical trial that aims at comparing a new treatment to a reference based on a binary endpoint (i.e. complete remission at week 16), which offers greater flexibility and simplicity of inference to the monitoring for patient safety and evidence of efficacy of small randomized trials.\n\nIt will use a Beta-Binomial model with a non-informative prior (Berry 2006). The posterior probability that the remission rate is at least 0.65 will be estimated in both arms, and the probability that the rate of remission in Arm B is above that in Arm A will be computed, with B indicating the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group.\n\nWe will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of remission in the arm A. After inclusion of nA patient in Arm A and yA complete remission observed. Using a beta Be(,) prior for , the posterior probability of  is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. \nIn our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm A will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment remission rate”. It has been set at 0.65 in this trial. Thus, we will compute \n\n\n\nSimilar analyses will be performed in arm B.\n\nHowever, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of experimental treatments. Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the other by some targeted minimal level. This will be done by computing the  posterior probability of the difference in remission rates between the two experimental arms (Kawasaki in 2012) being greater than zero, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group:\n\n\n\nAs we consider a Bayesian design an interim analysis will be performed without any “alpha spending“ after inclusion of 30 patients. If  >0.80,  >0.80 and if  >0.80. The trial will be stopped.\nIf  <0.10 or  <0.10 the corresponding arm will be stopped and the following patients will be included in the other arm.\nIf  <0.10 and  <0.10, the trial will be stopped.\nSources of funding for the trial: PHRC National 2019 - Ministère des solidarités et de la Santé\nTrial will have a Data Monitoring Committee: Yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size, involving young patients (from 15 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and mortality (1). Ocular disease in Behçet’s disease is frequent (60-90%) and may be associated with a poor functional prognosis. BD can involve anterior and/or posterior segment. It develops within the first few years of the disease onset and runs its most severe course during these years. Bilateral involvement is observed in 70–80% of patients at the beginning and becomes 90% when followed long-term (2). Male gender, posterior involvement, frequent attacks, strong vitreous opacity, and exudates alongside retinal vascular arcade are identified as poor prognostic factors. Sight-seeing BD include posterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis. The risk of visual loss reaches 25% at 5 years (3). TNF antagonists (anti-TNF) has been used for BD uveitis for 15 years (4). The incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction therapy in severe BD uveitis. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendation for the management of BD advocated TNF antagonists and steroids for all patients with sight threatening uveitis (5). Adalimumab and infliximab seems to be as effective for treatment of refractory non-infectious uveitis (6,7). According to the ‘Expert panel recommendations for the use of anti-TNF-a drugs in patients with ocular inflammatory disorders’, published in 2014, infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) may be used as first- or second-line corticosteroid-sparing therapy in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of BD (8). In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) (http://www.fda.gov) (http://www.ema.europa.eu) approved ADA for use in non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis, including those due to BD, based on two randomized double-blinded studies (9,10). Interferon-alpha can be used as an alternative but has a delayed action and induces many side effects (11). Contrasting with immunosuppressors or interferon-alpha, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. The only controlled study with a biologic was a non-randomized observational study that compared TNF antagonists with cyclosporine-A (3-5 mg/kg). The number of ocular attacks was significantly lower (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.91 perattacks/ 6 months) and the number of patients achieving complete remission was significantly higher in the TNF antagonists arm (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.071 to 3.12)(12). However, anti-TNFα failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of severe sight threatening uveitis (7). There is little published information on use of biologics other than anti-TNF for severe BD uveitis. There were no controlled studies comparing biotherapies in BD uveitis. Tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti-interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor, has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD (13–18). It seems to be rapidly effective in BD uveitis. TCZ may be effective in highly refractory BD-related uveitis (13–18). TCZ yielded a rapid reduction of ocular inflammation and led to long-term remission in these patients. According to several studies, IL6 level seems to be correlated to disease activity. IL6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine primarily secreted by mononuclear phagocytes, activated astrocytes and T cells. Increase IL6 level in CSF of neuro-BD patients has been reported to be correlated to long-term outcome and disease activity and proposed as disease activity marker. Chang et al. have found an increase susceptibility to BD in subjects carrying the IL6vntr*C allele and the IL6prom*G/IL6vntr*C haplotype (19). Increased IL-6 concentrations have been demonstrated in the vitreous fluid of chronic or acute uveitis patients (20). Moreover, TCZ has demonstrated efficacy in patients with refractory ocular inflammatory diseases (21–24). Interestingly, in the experimental model of autoimmune uveitis in mice, treatment with an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody also yielded dramatic reduction of uveal inflammation (20). UVB, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to Tocilizumab in sight threatening uveitis of BD. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in BD, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Arm A Adalimumab 80 mg at D0 then 40 mg subcutaneous at week 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and15 Arm B Tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneous each week for 15 weeks The experimental design is an open multicenter randomized clinical trial stratified by the main involvement at baseline (retinal vasculatis, and/or macular oedema), and according to newly diagnosed or relapsing disease with evaluation of the primary assessment criteria at week 16. We choose a Bayesian Phase II randomized clinical trial that aims at comparing the response rate at week 16 of an experimental treatment (Tocilizumab) to the reference (Adalimumab). Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources (Sharma 2011). Moreover, we choose to design the trial as a Bayesian clinical trial, for three main reasons. First, this allows incorporating information outside the trial that results in a decrease in required sample size due to such “fictive” observations. Secondly, Bayes designs are particularly well-suited for adaptive designs, given inference is based on accumulated data along the trial, allowing interim and sequential analyses without any inflation of type I error or biased estimation (Wang 2016). Third, this design is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements. Thus, an interim analysis that will use Bayesian inference will be performed after one year of enrolment. Given the uncertainty in the tocilizumab benefit over adalimumab in severe Behçet’s disease uveitis at this early stage of evaluation, and the fact that the severe population focused in this trial is not very large in size, the selection approach to planning sample size was worthy of consideration. We thus used the approach for phase II randomized trials proposed by Simon R, Wittes RE, and Ellenberg SS (1985) that aims at controlling the probability of detecting a given difference in response rates. We will use a Beta-Binomial model, with a non-informative prior (sensitivity analyses will be run with informative prior). The posterior probability that the treatment response rate is above 0.65, and the posterior probability that the Arm A is below the Arm B will be computed. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled (30 patients in Arm A and 30 patients in Arm B), previously shown as allowing conclusive results. An interim analyse will be performed after the inclusion of 30 patients. This national multicenters study, involving 26 clinical centers. Participating centers will be Internal medicine (or rheumatology) and Opthalmology departments of public hospitals located in France. The Selection of patient will be conducted by investigator of internal medicine (or rheumatology) and ophthalmology centers. Recruitment centres Patient’s inclusion and randomization (D0) will be performed by an investigator of internal medicine (or rheumatology) center. Visits of Follow-up will be conducted by investigator of internal medicine (or rheumatology). Non-recruitment centres Visits of Follow-up will be conducted by investigator of ophthalmology centers where a specific intervention to the research will be carried out (e.g. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Retinal angiography). The French national reference center for rare systemic autoimmune diseases and for autoinflammatory diseases located in the Pitie Salpetriere hospital, in Paris, is a leading center in the field of Behçet’s disease with a cohort of more than 1500 patients. The ophthalmology department of Pitie Salpétriere hospital is national reference center for uveitis. With the French Behçet’s network, we recently conducted a study on efficacy of anti-TNF in severe Behçet’s disease and recruited 124 patients in 1 year (7). The French Behçet’s research network is composed of multiple competence centers for Behçet’s disease related to the French national reference center for rare systemic autoimmune diseases and for autoinflammatory diseases and for uveitis. We are working in close collaboration with French ophthalmologists and rheumatologists including those from Pitie Salpetriere hospital, in Paris. Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 1 month following the premature discontinuation of treatment. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. If a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant's best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead. If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance. The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up If a patient's consent is withdrawn, the data collected prior to the withdrawal will be used, except if the patient does not allow investigators to use the already collected data. If the study is still in the inclusion period and if the withdrawn implies that the primary outcome could not be analysed, a new patient will be included, otherwise all patients included will be analysed and not replaced (Intention to treat Analysis). The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). When sending the email, please: Adopt a standardized nomming of the email subject in the following form: <<   Objet : YYYYYY_XXXXXX_jjmmaaaa (avec YYYYYY : code de la recherche, XXXXXX : acronyme de la recherche et jjmmaaaa : date de transmission).  >> - Send a SAE initial notification form and/or a follow-up report concerning a single participant for a given SAE, attachment may contain one (or more) document(s) (follow-up and hospitalization reports, for example). The total size of the email must be less than 8 MB, otherwise please send several e-mails. - Ensure that all documents transmitted (e.g. hospital reports) are anonymized and identified with the participant's identification number. For studies which use e-CRF the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the initial notification and follow-up report forms for pregnancy exposure during participation in a study. The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If  the investigational medicinal product is genotoxic and if it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.",

        "STATISTICAL": "As a general strategy, continuous efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using summary measures (median and interquartile range). Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be used to summarize categorical endpoints. Similarly, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categorical characteristics) Analyses by treatment group will be presented according to the treatment to which subjects were randomized. Disposition of the Study Subjects The disposition of subjects will be described with summaries by treatment group of the number of subjects enrolled, the number of subjects treated, and the number of subjects for whom study drug was permanently discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation). Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group. Exposure to Study Treatment and Compliance Frequency distributions of the number of received doses will be presented by treatment group. Treatment duration and treatment compliance for all randomized subjects will be described by treatment group. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint (complete remission of ocular involvement with prednisone (or prednisolone, only if prednisone is out of stock in the market) lower or equal to 5 mg/day at week 16 after randomization) will be modelled with a binary variable. The analysis will use a Beta-Binomial model with a non-informative prior (Berry 2006). The posterior probability that the remission rate is at least 0.65 will be estimated in both arms, as well as the probability that the rate of remission in Arm B is above that in Arm A will be computed, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group. We will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of remission in the arm A. After inclusion of nA patient in Arm A and yA complete response observed. Using a beta Be(,) prior for , the posterior probability of  is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. In our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm A will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment remission rate”. It has been set at 0.65 in this trial. Thus, we will compute Similarly, We will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of remission in the arm B. After inclusion of nB patient in Arm B and yB complete response observed. Using a beta Be(,) prior for , the posterior probability of  is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. In our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm B will be first assessed by comparison to 0.65 in this trial. Thus, we will compute for each arm: However, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of experimental treatments. Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the other by some targeted minimal level. This will be assessed by computing the value of the posterior probability of the difference in remission rates between the two experimental arms (Kawasaki in 2012) being greater than zero, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group: As we consider a Bayesian design an interim analysis will be performed without any “alpha spending“ after inclusion of 30 patients. If  >0.80,  >0.80 and if  >0.80, the trial will be stopped. If  <0.10 or  <0.10 the corresponding arm will be stopped and the following patients will be included in the other arm. If  <0.10 and  <0.10,  the trial will be stopped. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints Still with B the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group: Measures of corticosteroid sparing (mean dose at week 16, and cumulative dose) for subjects randomized to each arm will be estimated then compared across arms using normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Time to response onset will be estimated in each arm by Kaplan Meier estimator and compared using log-rank test. Mean acute-phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], at week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 for subjects randomized to each arm will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Rate and Time to occurrence of relapse or worsening while on study. (Relapse will be defined as the reappearance of clinical and/or paraclinical features of active disease or by the occurrence of new lesions or progression of preexisting lesions) will be estimated in each arms by Kaplan Meier estimator or appropriate usual estimator depending on the existence of competing risks. They will be compared using either log-rank test or Gray’s test. Means changes in Behcet’s Disease Current Activity Form and Behcet’s Syndrome Activity Score at week 8, 16 and 24 will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Means changes in other organs involved by BD at week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Means changes in quality of life (QOL) scales at week 16 and 24 will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Safety and tolerability of treatments in BD patients as assessed by frequency and severity of adverse clinical events at week 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 will be analysed as the primary endpoint Means changes in Tyndall, flare and Vitreous Haze at week 8, 16 and 24 will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors. The probability of the posterior difference in means (B-A) between the two experimental arms being greater than 0 will be computed. Means changes in Best corrected visual acuity (SNELLEN score) at week 8, 16 and 24 will be estimated then compared across arms using Normal Bayesian models with non-informative priors.

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: A multicenter, randomized, multi-arm trial comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Adalimumab, Anakinra and Tocilizumab in Subjects with Non-infectious Refractory Uveitis\nAcronym: RUBI : Refractory Uveitis BIotherapies\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr David SAADOUN\nCentre national de référence des maladies autoimmunes et systémiques rares\nDepartment of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology, Hospital Pitie Salpetriere\nTel.0142178088 / Email david.saadoun@psl.aphp.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: RUBI, is the first prospective randomized, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to either anakinra, or tocilizumab in refractory NIU. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory NIU. NIU can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal blindness. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of refractory/relapsing severe uveitis. The incidence of blindness in NIU has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious uveitis. Contrasting with immunosuppressors, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma.\nDespite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in uveitis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists.\nPrimary objective and assessment criterion: Primary Objective\n• To evaluate the efficacy of Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days) compared to anakinra (100mg/day) and tocilizumab (162mg/7 days) in subjects with refractory non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan- uveitis (NIU) and with a prednisone dose  0.1 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) at Week 16.\nPrimary Endpoint\n• Efficacy measured by the Percentage of patients with at least 2-step reduction in Vitreous Haze (according to Miami 9-step Scale) and with a dose  0.1 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent oral corticosteroid) at W16.\nSecondary objectives and assessment criteria: Secondary Objectives\n• To evaluate the change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\n• To evaluate the safety of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab in patients with NIU.\n• To evaluate the change in macular edema.\n• To evaluate the change in other signs of ocular inflammation.\n• To evaluate the effect on retinal vessel leakage.\n• To evaluate the effect of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab on steroid sparing.\n• To evaluate the change in ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber.\n• To evaluate the effect on underlying systemic disease when appropriate.\n• To evaluate the effect on ocular disease.\n• To evaluate the number and time to relapse of uveitis and the characteristics of uveitis at worsening.\n• To evaluate the time to treatment failure\nSecondary Endpoints, all measured at 16 weeks\n• Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\n• Change in macular edema.\n• Change in other signs of ocular inflammation.\n• Retinal vessel leakage.\n• Steroid sparing.\n• Ocular inflammation in the anterior chamber.\n• Underlying systemic disease when appropriate.\n• Ocular disease.\n• Number and time to relapse of uveitis and the characteristics of uveitis at worsening.\n• Adverse events\n• Time to treatment failure\nExperimental design: This is a prospective phase II clinical trial, multicenter, multi-arm, randomized (1:1:1) clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Adalimumab, anakinra and tocilizumab in subjects with active and refractory non-infectious intermediate, posterior, or pan-uveitis.\nOral corticosteroids should be at a stable dose 30 days prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0. All systemic immunosuppressants must have been discontinued 30 days prior to the first study drug administration on Day 0. Patients will have access to oral corticosteroids if needed before Day 0.\nPopulation involved: Adult patients with active and Refractory Non-infectious Uveitis (NIU)\n1. Active disease: either the presence of VH ≥4 on the Miami 9-step scale, and/or macular edema (CRT ≥300 microns), and/or other signs of intraocular inflammation (eg, perivascular sheathing of retinal vessels or leakage of retinal vessel on FA).\n2. Recently active disease: evidence of activity within the 3 months prior to inclusion visit as per VH ≥4 on the Miami 9-step scale (or VH >1+ according to SUN classification), and/or macular edema (CRT ≥300 microns), and/or other signs of intraocular inflammation (e.g., perivascular sheathing of retinal vessels or leakage of retinal vessels on FA). The activity status (active disease or recently active disease) has to be confirmed for all patients before the randomization by the Reading Center evaluation of VH, OCT and FA assessments.\n3. Refractory disease: At inclusion, subjects must be receiving oral corticosteroids (>10 mg/day prednisone equivalent and <80mg/day) and at least one other immunosuppressive (azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetyl, cyclosporine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide); or interferon (IFN)-α; or being intolerant to such immunosuppressive therapies.\nInclusion criteria: The eligibility criteria will be checked at the selection visit (which takes place four weeks maximum prior to inclusion visit) and at the inclusion/randomization visit.

Stage III and IV New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac insufficiency\nTreatment being tested: Eligible patients with active and refractory NIU will randomized at 1:1:1 ratio between\nArm 1: Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks\nArm 2: Anakinra (100 mg/day subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks\nArm 3: Tocilizumab (162 mg/7 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks.\nThe three treatment groups will receive the same corticosteroid regimen. All patients with NIU will receive oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 40 mg/day of prednisone or equivalence. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive:\n- 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone until week 4.\n- 0.4 mg/ kg/day of prednisone from week 4 to week 6\n- 0.3 mg/ kg/day of prednisone from week 6 to week 8.\n- 0.2 mg/ kg/day of prednisone from week 8 to week 12\n- ≤0.1 mg/ kg/day of prednisone from week 12 to week 16.\nDue to the CSI recommendation of the 18/06/2019, inclusion in the Anakinra arm has been stopped and the investigational medicinal product Anakinra has been discontinued in patients undergoing follow-up. Thus we modified the planned analyses and the randomisation accordingly. After the inclusion and randomisation of 54 patients, the next patients will be randomized 1:1 either in the 2 remaining arms:\n• Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks\n• Arm 3: Tocilizumab (162 mg/7 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks.\nIn practice, it means that the remaining 66 planned patients will be randomized (33 in arm 1 and 33 in arm 3).\nOther procedures added by the research: - Ophthalmologic visit at weeks 8 and 16\n- Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiogram (FA/ICG) at week 16 and ocular coherence tomography (OCT) at weeks 8 and 16\nRisks added by the research: Risk C\nPractical procedure: The randomization will be stratified by retinal vasculitis, macular oedema and underlying disease. At randomization, the patient will be under treatment with prednisone.\nOne study eye will be selected. If both eyes are eligible for the study (as per inclusion/exclusion criteria) the following rules will be respected:\n• The eye with active disease will be selected versus the eye with recently active disease, as defined by the protocol.\n• If both eyes present active disease documented by the same unique parameter, the eye with the worse score will be selected.\n• If both eyes present active disease defined by several parameters, the eye with the worse score ranked as follows will be selected: 1 Vitreous Haze; 2 cystoid macular edema (CME); 3 retinal vascular leakage and 4 best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\nIf both eyes have an equivalent score, the right eye will be selected. All patients will receive ocular coherence tomography (OCT) at enrolment, month 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 and a fluorescein and indocyanine green angiogram (FA/ICG) at enrolment, month 2 and 4 or at all visits in case of vasculitis or worsening.\nNumber of subjects chosen: 120\nNumber of centres: 37 departments of 17 French public hospitals\nResearch period: Duration of inclusions: 56 months\nDuration of participation of each patient: 7 months maximum\nTotal duration of the study: 63 months\nNumber of inclusions expected per centre and per month: 0.4 patient/month/centre\nStatistical analysis: We will use a Bayesian Multi-Arm Multi-Stage (MAMS) design that aim at comparing several new treatments (multi-arm), in order to select or drop any treatment arm to move forward when such evidence already exists based on interim analyses\nThe randomization will be stratified by retinal vasculitis, macular oedema and underlying disease. At randomization, the patient will be under treatment with prednisone as single therapy.\nFunding source: PHRC 2015\nData Safety Monitoring Board anticipated: Yes",

        "PROCEDURE": "Notification of an SAE must initially be provided in a written report using the special form for reporting SAE. The report must be signed by the investigator. Each item in the form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. This initial notification must be followed by one or more detailed follow-up report(s), in writing and signed, within a maximum of 8 days in the case of a fatal or life-threatening event and within 15 days for all other cases. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be made anonymous. In addition, the documents must include the following: research acronym, number and initials of the subject, nature and date of the serious adverse event. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has left the trial. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports, and all other documents must be sent to AP-HP by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It is possible to send the SAE to the AP-HP’s Safety department by fax No. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE by e-mail. This is to avoid duplicated reports. The investigator must comply with all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Vigilance Division of the DRCI can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr In utero exposure: The investigator completes the \"form for monitoring a pregnancy that developed during a biomedical research\", found in and sends it by e-mail to the Vigilance Division at eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.) the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAE. If the exposure involves the father, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor via e-mail only to the Vigilance Division - of the DRCI, e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr)..",
        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "Those responsible for biomedical research quality control (Article L.1121-3 of the French Public Health Code) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information about the experimental medications, the research, the research subjects and in particular the identity of the subjects and the results obtained. These individuals, as well as the investigators themselves, are subject to professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Penal Code). During or after the biomedical research, the data collected about the research subjects and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised parties) will be made non-identifying. Under no circumstances should the names and addresses of the subjects involved be shown. The sponsor will ensure that each research subject has given permission in writing for access to personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the research. Data will be entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF) by staff dedicated to this task.",
        "STATISTICAL": "Due to the CSI recommendation of the 18/06/2019, inclusion in the Anakinra arm has been stopped. Thus we modified the planned analyses and the randomisation accordingly. After the inclusion and randomisation of 54 patients, the next patients will be randomized 1:1 either in the 2 remaining arms: • Arm 1: Adalimumab (80mg then 40mg/14 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks • Arm 3: Tocilizumab (162 mg/7 days subcutaneously) (n=40) for 16 weeks. In practice, it means that the remaining 66 planned patients will be randomized (33 in arm 1 and 33 in arm 3). As a general strategy, continuous efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using summary measures (median and interquartile range). Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be used to summarize categorical endpoints. Similarly, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categoriel characteristics) Analyses by treatment group will be presented according to the treatment to which subjects were randomized",

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Multicenter, randomized, prospective trial comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Infliximab to that of Cyclophosphamide in severe Behçet’s disease\nAcronym: ITAC : Induction Therapy with Anti-TNFα vs Cyclophosphamide in severe Behçet disease\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr David SAADOUN\nCentre de reference des maladies autoimmunes et systémiques rares\nDepartment of Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology\n83 bd de l’hôpital\n75013 Paris\nHospital Pitie Salpetriere\nTel.0142178088\nEmail david.saadoun@psl.aphp.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to that of cyclophophamide in severe manifestations of BD. Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Therape\nutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular, or neurological involvement. Early recognition and vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological involvement. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However, the outcome of severe complications of BD is still poor. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendation (updated in 2016) for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNF plus glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel involvement) but recommendations on vascular disease and neurological involvement are based largely on expert opinion and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies. The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent.. TNFa antagonists have been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases. In addition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of anti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD manifestations. Physicians are still prescribing these compounds off-label use. We therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in severe and difficult to treat BD patients.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: To assess the benefit of infliximab comparatively to that of cyclophosphamide  in severe life-threatening Behçet’s disease.\nPrimary assessment criterion will be the complete clinical response at week 22 after randomization\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: To estimate and compare the rate and time to occurrence of relapses or worsening \nTo estimate and compare the cumulative dose of steroids\nTo estimate and compare the adverse events \nTo estimate and compare the mean change in SF-36 quality-of-life (see Appendix 3)\nTo estimate and compare the rate of remission according to organs involved \nTo compare the changes in acute-phase reactants, \nTo estimate and compare the changes in CNS involvement\nTo estimate and compare the changes in Cardio-vascular involvement\nSurvival and event free survival\nTo estimate and compare the changes in other BD manifestations\nTo estimate and compare the changes in Behcet’s Disease Current Activity Form (see Appendix 2)\nTo assess serum concentration measurement of TNFa inhibitor\n\nSecondary endpoints\n\n- Complete clinical response at week 12 and 48. \n-     Remission of CNS and/or cardiovascular involvement at week 12, 22 and 48.\n- Measures of corticosteroid sparing  :\no Percent meeting targets [≤ 0.1 mg/day/kg of prednisone] at week 22 and 48. \no Mean dose at week 12, 22 and 48. \no Cumulative dose at week 12, 22 and 48.\n- Time to response onset\n- Measures of acute-phase reactant :\n  \no C-reactive protein [CRP]) every 4 weeks\n- Relapse : \no Time to relapse (Relapse will be defined as the reappearance of clinical and/or paraclinical features of active disease or by the occurrence of new lesions at week 48.\no Rate of relapse \n- Worsening\no Time to occurrence of worsening. (Worsening will be defined as the progression of preexisting lesions) at week 22 and 48.\no Rate of worsening \n- Gobal survival at week 22 and 48.\n- Event free survival at week 22 and 48 defined by the occurrence of death, relapse or worsening.\n- Safety and tolerability of treatments in BD patients as assessed by frequency and severity of adverse clinical events at week 22.\n- Change in quality of life (QOL) (SF-36V2TM Health Survey) at week 12 and 22.

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and mortality [1]. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular, or neurological involvement [2]. Early recognition and vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to blindness in up to 20% at 4 years and a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological involvement [3, 4]. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years [5]. The outcomes of severe complications of BD improved but immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of refractory/relapsing BD cases [3, 4, 6-8]. TNFα expression correlate with BD activity and other immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with biologics. A recent case series have reported up to 85% of complete response with anti-TNFα agents in BD patients with major vessel involvement [9]. The incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of anti-TNF, raising the question of whether anti-TNFα agents should be used earlier in the treatment of BD.  The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendation (updated in 2016, paper submitted) for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNFα plus glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel involvement) [10] but recommendations on vascular disease and neurological involvement are based largely on expert opinion and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies. The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent. Only one randomized, controlled trial, has been performed to date, in mild form of BD and concluded that etanercept (ETA) was efficient on mucocutaneous manifestations and arthritis [11].  However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD manifestations. Physicians are still prescribing these compounds off-label use. We therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in severe and difficult to treat BD patients. ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to cyclophophamide in severe manifestations of Behçet’s disease (BD).",
        "PROCEDURE": "• Arm A Infliximab 5mg/kg intravenously at week 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18 • Arm B Cyclophosphamide 0.7g/m² up to 1.2 g/ m2, intravenously at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 The experimental design is a multicentric open multicenter randomized clinical trial stratified on the characteristics of the initial Behçet’s disease with evaluation of the primary assessment criteria at week 22. The primary assessment criteria and the final measures of corticosteroid sparing will be reviewed by a endpoint adjudication committee blinded of the randomization. This committee will have the role of validating under blind conditions the following assignments: complete remission, treatment failure and relapse of the disease. It will consist of persons external to the Study:   Clinicians specializing in the pathology under consideration: Prof B Wechsler (Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital).  Radiologist: Dr S Boussouar (Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital) and Dr D Leclercq (Pitié-Salpétrière Hospital). It will meet at the end of the study. The RCT will use an adaptive Bayesian design for phase II randomized national multicentre clinical trial that aims at comparing a new treatment to a reference based on a binary endpoint (i.e. complete clinical response at week 22), which offers greater flexibility and simplicity of inference to the monitoring for patient safety and evidence of efficacy of small randomized trials. • Day 0 : Eligibility for enrollment is determined.

The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the subject (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the subject is alive or dead If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Other medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up The investigator should initially complete a SAE reporting form  (contained in the case report form). This report must be signed by the investigator. The investigator must complete every section of the SAE form so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate assessment. The initial report sent to the sponsor must be rapidly followed up by one or more additional written reports describing the course of the event and any complementary information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be anonymized. In addition, the investigator must state the study acronym and the number and initials of the study participant on each paper. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has terminated his participation in the trial. The reception of the SAE form to the vigilance department is centralized to allow immediate processing of SAE as soon as they are received. The initial SAE notification, the SAE monitoring reports and any other document will be sent to the sponsor represented by its Vigilance department  by fax (+33 1 44 84 17 99). It is possible to transmit the SAE form to the Vigilance department by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE form by fax.\n\nNB: Do not transmit by e-mail the documents initially successfully transmitted by fax to avoid duplication. For trials which use e-CRF the investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by fax; In case of failure to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE report form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the investigator must complete the SAE report form in the e-CRF. The investigator must comply with all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the initial notification and follow-up report forms for pregnancy exposure during trial participation\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy ends, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy report form, the SAE follow-up forms and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor using the same modalities as described above. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. Special rules for trials involving the administration of a radioactive product (e.g. PET scan): if a subject develops secondary cancer/cancer or develops a hereditary deficiency following exposure to ionising radiation, the investigator shall complete the special form for reporting cancer",

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "The persons responsible for the quality control of clinical studies (Article L.1121-3 of the French Public Health Code) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to the investigational medicinal products, the study, the study participants and in particular the identity of the participants and the results obtained. These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the French Criminal Code). During and after the clinical study, all data collected about the study participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be anonymised. Under no circumstances will the names and addresses of the subjects be shown. Only the subject's initials will be recorded, along with an identification code specific to the study indicating the order of enrolment. The sponsor will ensure that each subject has agreed in writing for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed. Data entry will be carried out on electronic media via a web browser.",
        "STATISTICAL": "This is a Bayesian Phase II randomized clinical trial that aims at evaluating the best treatment strategy of severe Behçet’s disease, based on difference in the response rate as measured at week 22 after randomization. Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions.  Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources (Sharma 2011). Moreover, we chose to design the trial as a Bayesian clinical trial, for three main reasons. First, this allows incorporating information outside the trial that results in a decrease in required sample size due to such “fictive” observations. Secondly, Bayes designs are particularly well-suited for adaptive designs, given inference is based on accumulated data along the trial, allowing interim and sequential analyses without any inflation of type I error or biased estimation (Wang 2016).Third, this design is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements.  Thus, an interim analysis that will use Bayesian inference will be performed after one year of enrolment (as described below). An interim analysis will be performed once one-half of the projected numbers of patients have been recruited into the study. It will use a Beta-Binomial model with a non-informative prior (Berry 2006). The posterior probability that the response rate is at least 0.70, and that the rate of response in the experimental arm is above that observed in the control will be computed. We will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of response in the arm A=k (k=1,2). Using a beta Be(,) prior for k, the posterior probability of k is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. In our setting, the inefficacy of the drug will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment response rate”. It has been set at 0.70 in this trial. Thus, we will compute for each arm: (1) However, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of the experimental treatment over the control arm (Whitehead 2014). Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the control by some targeted minimal level. This will be done by computing the value of the posterior probability of the difference in response rates between the experimental arm and the control (Xie 2012): (2)"

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Efficacy of 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in kidney transplant recipients, a multicentre randomized non-inferiority trial.\nAcronym: SHORTCUT\nCoordinating Investigator: Dr Matthieu Lafaurie, Infectious Diseases, Saint Louis hospital, Paris\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. In kidney transplant recipients (KTR) urinary tract infection (UTI) represent 45–72% of all infections, and 30% of all hospitalizations for sepsis. Acute transplant pyelonephritis are the most common complications occurring in more than 20% of patients, mainly in the first year after transplantation. They are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney rejection and long-term kidney graft dysfunction. Gram-negative bacteria, mainly E. coli, account for more than 70% of UTI in KTR. As those infections are favored by urinary tract modifications/defects and immunosuppression, they are often recurrent and necessitate repeated courses of antibiotics. Selective pressure due to antibiotic consumption, along with frequent hospital admissions and immunosuppression, are well known risk factors for the development of antibiotic resistant infections. Multidrug (MDR)- or extensively (XDR)- drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae including ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing organisms, are thus increasingly observed in transplant units and represent a global threat as very few new antibiotics are expected in the next decade. \n One main strategy to limit antimicrobial resistance is to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment. A 7 day-course is recommended for simple acute pyelonephritis (APN) treated with fluoroquinolones or parenteral B-lactams, prolonged up to 10 or 14 days in the presence of underlying disease at risk of complications. Most KT teams treat patients between 14–21 days as recommended by American guidelines. However, the need to extend treatment duration in immunosuppressed patients is a poorly defined concept and the optimal duration of treatment for APN in KTR is not known as these patients are excluded from most studies.\n As there is an urgent need to reduce antibiotic consumption in this population at high risk of developing infections due to resistant pathogens, the hypothesis is that a 7 day-treatment is sufficient to cure APN with good clinical response after 48h of treatment in KTR and is as effective as 14 days.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: To show that a 7 day-antibiotic therapy is not inferior to a 14 day-antibiotic therapy in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in kidney transplant recipients.\nPrimary endpoint: Clinical cure and no additional antibiotic treatment since the end of antibiotic treatment up to the main evaluation at day 30.\nClinical cure is defined as fever <38°C and no symptoms of UTI.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: To compare between both arms:\n-Clinical cure at day 90 and day 180 \n-Microbiological cure at day 30, 90 and 180\n-Tolerance and safety of antibiotics\n-Hospitalization length stay\n-Antibiotic consumption during total follow up\n-Acquisition of antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae\n-Kidney graft function and transplant rejection \nat day 90 and day 180 \n- The total costs.\nTo evaluate risk factors for failure and relapse/recurrence.\nTo evaluate efficacy of the antibiotic treatment at the end of treatment (D7 for experimental arm and D14 for control group)\n\nSecondary endpoints: \n- Clinical cure at day 90 and 180\n- Microbiological cure *at day 30, 90 and 180\n- Incidence of relapse /recurrence between day 30 and day 90\n- Incidence of adverse events imputable to antibiotic treatment\n- Kidney function assessed according to MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) or CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration) epi \n- Hospitalization length stay defined by the delay between the date of inclusion and the date of hospital discharge\n- Antibiotic consumption \n- Rectal carriage of antibiotic resistant Enterobacteriaceae at inclusion and day 30\n*Microbiological cure is defined as a sterile urine or uropathogene ≤ 103 CFU/mL in urine culture.\nDesign of the trial: Multicenter, controlled, randomized, non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (1:1): 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment.\nThe randomization will be stratified by date of renal transplantation (≤ 1 year and > 1 year), center and sex (potential confounders).\nPopulation of trial subjects: KTR with acute pyelonephritis\nInclusion criteria: -Age >18 years KTR\n-APN defined by: fever (T°≥38°C) (with or without clinical signs and/or symptoms of UTI) and pyuria (≥104 white blood cells/mL or ≥10/mm3) and positive urine culture (uropathogen ≥103 CFU/mL susceptible to the empirically administrated antibiotic)\n-No confirmed or suspected febrile non urinary bacterial infection \n-No urologic/renal complication at baseline imaging (abscess, obstruction...) \n- Favourable early response to antibiotic treatment:( 48 to 60 hours after the first dose of antibiotic effective against the causative uropathogen) defined by: T°<38°C and improvement (or resolution) of signs and/or symptoms of urinary tract infection if present at diagnosis.\n- Written informed consent\nExclusion criteria: Patients with any of the following conditions:\n-Severe or complicated condition\n   - Any rapidly progressing disease or immediately life-threatening illness, including, but not limited to, septic shock, current or impeding respiratory failure, acute heart or liver failure\n   -   Admission or stay in intensive care unit at baseline\n   -   Obstruction of the urinary tract\n   -   Renal, perinephric or prostatic abscess\n- prior inclusion in this study \n- current participation to another interventional study\n-Dual antibiotic therapy ((prophylactic antibiotic such as cotrimoxazole allowed) )(only 1 dose of aminoside is allowed before randomization)\n-First month post transplantation  \n-Current indwelling catheter (including bladder catheter, ureteral stents, percutaneous nephrostomy tubes)\n-Neurogenic bladder\n-Enterocystoplasty\n-Immunodeficiency or immunosuppressive therapy not related to kidney transplantation, including hematologic malignancy, cancer, asplenia, neutropenia<500 neutrophils/mm3, \n-Pregnancy, breastfeeding\n-Hypersensitivity or previous severe adverse drug reaction to the antibiotic therapy\n-Unable or unwilling, in the judgment of the investigator, to comply with the protocol\n-Life expectancy<1 month\n-Patient under legal guardianship or without healthcare coverage\n-Homeless patient\n-Women with childbearing potential not using adequate contraception\nComparator treatment: Standard (14 days) antibiotic duration\nInterventions added for the trial: 2 swabs for bacterial resistance rectal carriage study and 1 follow-up consultation will be added to the standard procedure\nRisks added by the trial: UTI could relapse more frequently in the short duration arm if non inferiority is not demonstrated. This will require a new antibiotic treatment for the patient.\nScope of the trial: Phase IV trial\nNumber of subjects included: 470\nNumber of sites: 10\nDuration of the trial: Length of participation to the study: 6 months\nLength of Inclusion period: 36 months\nTotal study duration: 42 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 1-2\nStatistical analysis: Sample sizes of 235 in each group achieve 80% power to detect a non-inferiority margin difference between the group proportions of -0.05. The reference group proportion is 0.95. The treatment group proportion is assumed to be 0.90 under the null hypothesis of inferiority. The power was computed for the case the actual treatment group proportion is 0.90. The test statistic used is the one-sided Z test (unpooled). The significance level of the test is 0.05\nSources of funding for the trial: Ministry of Health\nTrial will have a Data Monitoring Committee: yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "As there is an urgent need to reduce antibiotic consumption in Kidney Transplant Recipients (KTR), a population at high risk of developing infections due to resistant pathogens and antibiotic-induced Clotridioides difficile Infections (CDI), our hypothesis is that a 7 day-treatment is sufficient to cure Acute Pyelonephritis (APN) with good clinical response after 48h of treatment and is as effective as 14 days of treatment.",
        "PROCEDURE": "As stated, the ward physicians will have the responsibility of antibiotic prescription. However, guidelines will encourage prescriptions according to the current French recommendations for non KTR patients The choice of the prescribed ICD, of the posology, the route and mode of administration is independent of the research but depend on the characteristics of the pathogen, of the national and local recommendations, of renal function and other parameters’ characteristic of the patient For each of the ICD any of the specialities of a generic group (or speciality considered as equivalent by local COMEDIMS) are susceptible to be prescribed. Acceptable contraceptive measures In accordance with CTFG recommendation, acceptable contraceptive methods are: -Progesterone-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action; - Male or female condom with or without spermicide 5; - Cap, diaphragm with spermicide 5 A combination of male condom with either, cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide are also considered acceptable. Phase IV trial Multicenter, controlled, randomized, non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial with 2 parallel groups (1:1): 7 days versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The open design was selected because of the heterogeneity of microorganisms responsible for APN in KT and thus the multiplicity of antibiotics that will be prescribed, making a blind trial unfeasible. 10 Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of the treatment , the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of the treatment but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of study-related treatment , and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect all the assessment criteria at the moment the subject exits from the study, if the participant agrees. Schedule further follow-up visits for the participant, especially in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 1 months following the premature discontinuation of treatment. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. If a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. If, during the course of his/her participation in the study, the participant presents one of the following exclusion criteria, then the study product/procedure must be discontinued but the participant will continue to be monitored for the study. List the relevant exclusion criteria The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional examination, etc.). These documents must be non identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym and the number and participant initials.. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has left the study.. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99, only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by email; If it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE report form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the investigator must complete the SAE report form in the e-CRF. The investigator must respond to all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the \"report and follow-up form for pregnancy during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein The investigator will allow the sponsor’s representatives to monitor the study at the frequency defined in the contract, depending on enrolment at each center. Case Report Forms (CRFs) and related source documents will be reviewed in detail during monitoring visits (completeness, adherence to the guidelines, accuracy compared to source documents). The sponsor’s representative will also review regulatory documents, drug storage and accountability. The investigator must keep a comprehensive and centralized filing system for all study-related documents that would be suitable for inspection by the sponsor’s monitors or representatives of any other regulatory agency. The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations. This research is governed by the CNIL (French Data Protection Agency) “Reference Methodology for processing personal data used within the scope of health research” (amended MR-001). AP-HP, as sponsor of the research, has signed a declaration of compliance with this “Reference Methodology”",

Disposition of the Study Subjects: The disposition of subjects will be described with summaries by treatment group of the number of subjects enrolled, the number of subjects treated, and the number of subjects for whom study drug was permanently discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation). In order to address non inferiority questions, confidence intervals at 95% of the main endpoint will be calculated and its lower threshold compared to the margin of non-inferiority (5%) planned in the trial. For superiority questions or for secondary criteria, effect sizes will be appreciated using point estimates with a confidence interval of 95%, using statistical tests adapted to each criterion. Effects measured on right-censored criteria will be hazard ratios, the effect on proportions will be measured by relative risks and the difference between risks. These estimations will be adjusted on prognostic factors. All tests will be two-sided with p-values of 0.05 or less denoting statistical significance. All tests will be based on a two sided alpha risk of 0.05. For the primary endpoint it corresponds to a unilateral test considering an alpha risk of 0.025."

        "SUMMARY": "Name of the study: CAALL-F01: a French protocol for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children and adolescents\nStudy committee representatives: Coordinating investigator:               Pr André BARUCHEL \nCo-coordinating Investigator:   Pr Yves BERTRAND \nMethodologist/Biostatistics:      Pr Sylvie CHEVRET \nLeukemia Biology Coordination:       Pr Hélène CAVE \nAsparaginase Studies Dr Jean-François BENOIST \n                                          Dr Christine SABAN\nStudy Sponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nMain backgrounds: 1. ALL is now a curable disease in 80-90% of children and 70-80% of the adolescents. Nevertheless numerous problems remain\nThese good results are obtained with intensive and prolonged treatments which include risk of toxic death, sequelae, and secondary malignancies.\nResults are still insufficient for high-risk forms, particularly those exhibiting an  early resistance to chemotherapy\nEarly bone marrow relapses (less than 30 months after diagnosis) still have a dismal prognosis which renders their prevention mandatory\nALL is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of biology and response to treatment. To envisage targeted treatments in the future renders key to decipher this heterogeneity. \nThe two cooperative groups FRALLE and the French centers of the EORTC-CLCG have decided to elaborate a common protocol for the treatment of childhood and adolescent ALL: Childhood and Adolescent ALL-France- 01(CAALL-F01).\n\nThe two previous studies from these groups have comparable results:\n\n\n2. A still major question in the field of ALL is the optimal use of L-asparaginase (ASNase)\nIt is known that administering ASNase results in the depletion of asparagine circulating in the blood, which starves the leukemic cells and results in their death. But indeed the use of ASNase varies between protocols considering the different brands, the dose and the administration modalities (rythm, route-IM or IV).\nThree major forms of ASNase are currently available: E. coli asparaginase (Kidrolase® in France), Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase®, for patients with allergy) and a pegylated form of E.coli Asparaginase (Oncaspar® in USA and in Europe). \n\n2.1.Oncaspar®in the USA\nOncaspar® (PEGylated E. coli asparaginase or pegaspargase manufactured initially by ENZON and now SHIRE/Servier) was developed with the goal of reducing the immunogenicity of the native ASNase. In addition, Oncaspar®, because of its prolonged serum terminal half-life (t1/2), can be dosed less frequently than native ASNase with achievement of similar PD. \nIn the USA, CCG-1962 was the pivotal clinical trial supporting first-line use of Oncaspar®. Children with standard risk ALL (n=118) were randomized to receive native or PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (API from Merck) as part of induction and 2 delayed intensifications (DI) phases. Oncaspar® was administered intramuscularly (IM) at a dose of 2,500 IU/m2 once during the 4-week induction phase and once during each of two 8-week DI phases. Native E. coli asparaginase from Merck (Elspar®) was administered IM at a dose of 6,000 IU/m2 three times weekly for 9 doses during induction and for 6 doses during each DI phase. Children treated with Oncaspar® had a more rapid clearance of lymphoblasts from Day 7 and Day 14 bone marrow aspirates and a more prolonged asparaginase activity than those treated with the native form. In the first DI phase, 26% of native asparaginase patients had high-titer antibodies compared to 2% of those patients receiving Oncaspar©. High titer antibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not the Oncaspar® arm. The rate of infections, hospitalizations and the safety profile were similar between the arms (Avramis et al., 2002). Oncaspar® is approved for the treatment of ALL as a component of multi-agent chemotherapy in the USA since 1994, including for first-line use since 2006. This first line use has been transferred to a “new” Oncaspar® manufactured by Sigma-tau (pegaspargase; asparaginase from Lonza) in 2011, and now by SHIRE.\n\n2.2. Oncaspar® in Europe\nUntil now, Oncaspar®, currently available in Europe differed from the Oncaspar® marketed in the USA in terms of the asparaginase origin (Kyowa-Hakko v. Lonza), although both products are pegylated by Sigma-Tau in the USA. \nIn Germany and Poland, Oncaspar KH (Kyowa-Hakko) is registered as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy for reinduction in patients with a known hypersensitivity to native L-asparaginase (second-line). \nOncaspar KH has been used as the first line asparaginase preparation in at least three European ALL protocols: UK MRC protocols for ALL since 2003 (UK), BFM-AIEOP protocol for ALL since 2010 (Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland; Czech Republic, Israel), INTERFANT (a protocol dedicated to infants with ALL) since 2006 (many countries). \nSince January 2016, the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization for use of ONCASPAR as a combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in pediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients. With this approval, Baxalta is authorized to market ONCASPAR in the 28 member countries of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. This authorization is related to the Oncaspar incorporating the API manufactured by Lonza. This authorization has been transferred to the subsequent owners : Shire and currently Servier\n 2.3 Current status of asparaginase preparations in France\nUntil January 2016, only Kidrolase® was registered for first line use. \nErwinase® is available for patients that are allergic to native or pegylated asparaginase (MAA in France: 30.03.2015). Oncaspar ® (Oncaspar KH) was available only under a named patient program (ATUOn 19 November 2015) until Oncaspar ® received a marketing authorization on january 2016. 3. Different dosing and schedules using ONCASPAR® during induction therapy are currently proposed according to first-line ALL protocols opened at that date.\n- 2500 IU/m2 one infusion: COG and DFCI protocols (US) (using ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 3500 IU/m2 one infusion: St Jude protocol (US) (ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 2500 IU/m2 two infusions: AIEOP-BFM protocol (Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 two infusions: EORTC protocol (Belgium) (ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 one infusion: Interfant 06 protocol (mainly Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1000 IU/m2 two infusions: UKALL protocol (UK)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1500 IU/m2 two infusions: DCOG protocol (NL)(ONCASPAR KH) \n4. The results of the 2003 Protocol UKALL are interesting: EFS 86% at 5 years, overall survival at 5 years 92% (Vora A et al, Lancet Oncol 2013 and 2014). They have been obtained by using a low dosage per infusion of Oncaspar KH (1000 IU/m2 IM) but repeated at 15 day intervals for induction.\nIn a subgroup of 482 patients treated in UKALL 2003, CYK Fong et al (ASH 2011) show that the dose that provides adequate asparaginase activity (> 100 IU/L) in 86% of samples studied after the 1st and second injection.\nQuestions asked in the CAALL-F01 protocol: This French protocol will be the first in Europe to use the ONCASPAR® LONZA used in the USA since 2012 (first approval in 1994 was for another “ONCASPAR®  manufactured with a Merck API).\nRandomized question: what is the best way to administer pegaspargase? A cohort of children and adolescents with standard or medium risk ALL will be randomized to receive during induction either one infusion of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) 2500 IU/m2 at D12 or two infusions of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) at 1250 IU/m2 each at D12 and D26. Patients will then receive 2500 IU/m2 or 1250 IU/m2 per dose during consolidation and delayed intensification according to the initial arm of randomization. \nNon randomized question: In the High/Very High Risk groups, a non randomized intensification of the scheme of asparaginase administration is proposed during induction therapy: 2 infusions of 2500 IU/m2/day (D12 and D26) will be administered. All patients will receive 2500 IU/m2 per dose during consolidation and delayed intensifications.\nPrimary objectives: For children and adolescents with standard or medium risk ALL, the study has two primary objectives: 1) to assess the superiority in terms of PK at D33 of the fractionated scheme; 2) to assess the equivalence in the tolerance of the 2 schemes (from D12 of induction to D49)\nIn the High/Very High Risk group two primary objectives have been defined: 1) to assess the PK at D33; 2) to assess the toxicity of the intensified scheme from D12 of induction to D49\nMain end-points: Adequate asparaginase activity (>100 IU/L) at D33 of induction\nToxicity: Incidence of severe toxicities (Grade ≥ 3) directly asparaginase-related (CNS thrombosis, pancreatitis, anaphylaxia, and hyperbilirubinemia) between D12 and D49 of treatment and anyway before D8 of consolidation\nSecondary end-points: 1. Linked to the study Drug\nPHARMACOKINETICS/ PHARMACODYNAMICS /IMMUNOGENICITY:\nA comparison of the 2 arms will be made for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk ALL. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups.\nThe criteria will include:\nAsparaginase activity and asparagine levels at defined time-points\nIncidence of asparaginase antibodies\nIncidence of silent inactivation in both arms during induction, consolidation and intensification phase(s)\nAllergic reaction rate in both arms during induction, consolidation and intensification phase(s)\nPercentage of patients without switch to Erwinia asparaginase \nPercentage of patients receiving more than 95% of the intended dose of asparaginase\nEFFICACY\nA comparison of the 2 arms will be made for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk ALL. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups.\nThe criteria for efficacy will include:\nMorphological CR rates assessed on the whole population or on subgroups (B-Lineage ALL, T-cell ALL).\nMinimal Residual Disease (MRD) at the end of induction (TP1) and at the later time-point (TP2)(TP3 for a subgroup of patients) assessed by Ig/TCR-based RQ-PCR. This evaluation will be made in the whole population and within subgroups \nCumulative Incidence of relapses \nCumulative Incidence of BM relapses, CNS relapses, gonadal relapses, combined relapses\n\nTOXICITY\nA comparison of the 2 arms will be undertaken for the patients with Standard-Risk or Medium-Risk ALL. A non comparative assessment will be made for patients belonging to the High-Risk/Very High Risk-groups.\n\nAll other adverse events (AE) related to asparaginase occurring within the first 7 weeks (D49) of treatment and anyway before D8 of consolidation:\nHyperglycemia / induced diabetes, coagulopathy, allergy, hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypercholesterolemia)\nNon CNS thrombosis\nGrade 1-2 AE: pancreatitis, hyperbilirubinemia, \nAdverse events related to asparaginase but occurring after D49 of induction or anyway at D8 of consolidation or after\nIncidence of all grade 3-4 adverse events, whatever their imputability.\n\nSURVIVAL TIME-POINTS \n5-year event-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival are classical outcome measures for the evaluation of survival in children with ALL.\nEvent-free survival is the survival time free of treatment failure, relapse or secondary malignancy from Day 1 of treatment or after randomization (in randomized arms); disease-free survival is the event-free survival in responders measured from the time of complete remission following induction. Treatment failure is defined after induction at day 35-day 42, by at least 5% blasts and MRD >= 5x10-2. In case of no available MRD, only the >=5% blasts criterion will be required.\n\n2-other secondary objectives\nto evaluate the incidence of rare subgroups of ALL and their prognostic value e.g. so-called “B-other” subgroup: BCR-ABL like (including EBF1-PDGFRB), MEF2D-X, ZNF384-X, TCF3-HLF…\n5 year EFS, DFS and OS of the rare patients with suboptimal response to therapy (induction failure or MRDTP1 ≥ 10-3) and ABL-class fusions ALLs treated with imatinib\nImatinib related adverse events (immediate and long term, cf appendix 9) in the rare patients with suboptimal response to therapy (induction failure or MRDTP1 ≥ 10-3) and ABL-class fusions ALLs treated with imatinib\nDefinitions: NCI Standard-risk ALL (all criteria)\nB-cell precursor ALL\n365 days < age <10 years\nWBC < 50 G/L\nNCI High-risk ALL \nB-cell precursor ALL \nage > 10 years or WBC ≥ 50 G/L\nT-cell ALL \nALL of the T-cell lineage\nCNS involvement: CNS3 status, according to current standard definitions for CNS1, CNS2, CNS3, and traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP)\nTestis involvement: clinical enlargement of one or both testes confirmed by ultrasonography\nPrednisone response (measured at D8 of induction therapy): \nGood prednisone response (GPR): less than 1000 blast cells/mm3 after 7 days of Prednisone 60 mg/m2/day and one intrathecal injection of methotrexate \nPoor Prednisone response (PPR): no good prednisone response\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) (measured after induction and during or after consolidation):  evaluation by Real time -Quantitative PCR after search for two Ig/TCR markers if possible or at least one with a minimum sensitivity of 10-4, according to the ESG-MRD recommendations.

Patients will be allocated either to receive one infusion of Oncaspar® 2500 IU/m2 vs. or 2 infusions of 1250 IU/m2 during induction therapy. The dose per infusion after induction therapy is the dose per infusion attributed by the initial randomization\nNo randomized question will be asked in the high/very high risk groups of the B and T lineage, these patients receiving 2 infusions of Oncaspar® 2500 IU/m2 during induction and 2500 IU/m2/infusion afterwards. Nevertheless, these patients will be submitted to the same evaluation in terms of PK/PD, toxicity and efficacy.\nAll patients will be included in the CAALL-F01 study before Day 8 of induction treatment. \nRandomization will take place between D8 and D11, i.e. 1-4 days before the first infusion of pegaspargase (D12), for patients belonging to the B-SR/B-MR/T-SR groups.\nInvestigational drug: Oncaspar® (pegaspargase;) is supplied as a sterile solution at the beginning of the trial and replaced by a powder for solution for injection. Both are packaged in Type I single-use vials containing 3,750 International Units of Native asparaginase per 5 mL solution.

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "The persons responsible for the quality control of an interventional research (article L.1121-3 of the Public Health Code) shall take all the necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of the information related to the experimental medicines, the research and the trial subjects, notably in relation to their identity as well as the results obtained. Like the investigators themselves, these persons are bound by professional secrecy (according to the conditions defined in articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Criminal Code). During the interventional research or at its conclusion, the data collected concerning the trial subjects and transmitted to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialized intervening party) shall be depersonalized. Under no circumstances should the names or addresses or any information allowing identification of the persons be visible. Only the initials of the first name and surname shall be recorded, accompanied by a coded research number indicating patients' order of inclusion. The sponsor shall ensure that each trial subject gives written consent for access to his/her personal data concerning which is strictly necessary for quality control of the research. Data entry will be carried out on electronic media via a web browser.",
        "STATISTICAL": "The analysis will be performed based on an intent-to-treat principle; once patients are randomized, all will be analyzed. This policy, known as the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis principle, is a cornerstone of good clinical trial practice. All participants randomized and entered into the trial should be included in the analysis of the group to which they were assigned including loss of follow-up, regardless of whether they completed the trial or switched to receive different treatment. Similar principle will surround the analysis of the uncontrolled part of the trial. The study's primary aims in the randomized part of the study provide two hypotheses testing. Therefore, the sample size has been computed to reach adequate statistical power for detecting the effects if present (see below, Section 10.2). As stated below, those numbers of patients to be included will be adjusted according to the results of the interim analysis. For the uncontrolled design, the sample size has been computed on the basis of expected prevalence of such patients during the enrolment of those to be randomized, that allow precision around the estimates that appeared satisfactory (see below, Section 10.2). Actually, given the uncertainties in estimates, one interim analysis will be performed based on all patients randomized before January, 1, 2018, as requested by the DSMB of the study on November 2017. It will have two main goals: (i) estimating the treatment effect on the EFS, and (ii) assessing the validity in estimates on which the sample sizes have been computed, with possible re-adjustment as described below. The statistical report will be based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). The baseline (i.e., at randomization) characteristics of the randomized groups will be compared roughly, based on estimations, with 95% confidence intervals and without any statistical tests of significance. Randomization is the best means for creating balanced groups. The right-censored endpoints (event-free survival, disease free survival and overall survival) will be estimated by the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method and compared between randomized groups by the log-rank test after checking for the proportionality of hazard functions. The treatment comparisons will be adjusted for imbalances or prognostic covariates using a multivariable Cox model, stratified on the lignage and risk group. The models will be evaluated based on the testing assumptions of the proportionality of hazard functions and log-linear relationships between the predictors and hazard. Competing risks endpoints (relapse incidence, etc) will be analyzed using competing risks methods. Specifically, the cumulative incidences of these events will be estimated considering deaths prior to the event of interest as competing risk outcomes and compared using the Gray test. The adjustments for potential confounders will be based on the cause-specific Cox model. All tests will be two-sided, with p-values of 0.05 or less denoting statistical significance. All analyses will be performed using the SAS (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) and R (http://www.R-project.org/) software packages."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Phase II multicentric study of pembrolizumab in classic or endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma\nAcronym: KAPKEY\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr Céleste LEBBE - Dermatologie - Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris - 0142494679 – celeste.Lebbe@aphp.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) are lymphangioproliferations associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies give at best 30-60% of transient responses. While  interferon responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic KS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since patients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive regimens nor antiviral therapies.\nPembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently been shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells in KS lesions.\nIn this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS.\nPrimary objective and assessment criterion: Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design :\nThe main objective is to assess whether pembrolizumab is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<5%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>30%) in classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), using the Simon’s 2 stage Optimal Design.\nThe primary endpoint will be the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response following ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months.\n\nExtension stage:\nIn case of truly active conclusion of the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design, an extension stage would be performed to assess more precisely the efficacy of pembrolizumab in our setting. 20 more patients will be included to obtain a more precise estimation of the treatment effect up to 24 months.\nThe primary endpoint of this extension stage will be the Best overall response rate according to ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it   occurs before 6 months.\nPatients included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design, will be followed until 24 months.\nSecondary objectives and assessment criteria: Secondary objectives are: (for Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design and Extension stage)\nto assess the safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma,\nto characterize the efficacy of pembrolizumab related to pharmacodynamics assessment\n\nSecondary endpoints:\nEfficacy endpoints\nDifferent aspects of clinical response will be evaluated:\nBest overall response rate according to Physical Global Assessment

endpoint\nResponse rate on lymphedema (circumference, scale of 0 (absence) to 3 (painful or oozing)) at Month 3, Month 6 and at best response as defined following the primary endpoint\nTime to response defined as the time to first response recorded from the start of treatment\nTime to progression\nResponse rate according to ACTG and PGA criteria at Month 9, Month 12, Month 18 and Month 24 for the Extension stage \nDuration of response defined as the time from starting treatment to progression in patients achieving partial or complete response\nQuality of life following the QLC-30 and

If necessary inclusion will be stopped during 6 months after the 9th inclusion waiting for the primary endpoint. The trial will stop with conclusion of inactivity if no response is observed in this stage; otherwise, 8 additional patients will be recruited to a total sample size of 17 patients, with at least 3 responses to indicate that the drug is effective enough. In case an observed response before the end of stage 1 the stage 2 will directly begin without any stop.\n\nExtension Stage:\nOnly the 20 patients included in the extension stage will be considered in this main analysis. With an expected complete best overall response rate (complete response, partial response) at 24 months of 14/20 (70%), we would obtain a 95%CI interval of the complete response rate equal to [46%;88%].\nA secondary analysis will be performed on the 20 patients included in the extension stage plus the 17 patients included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design. With an expected best\noverall response rate at 6 months of 26/37 (70.3%), this analysis will reach a 95%CI interval of the complete response rate equal to [53%;84%].\nFunding source: Merck\nData Safety Monitoring\nBoard anticipated: YES",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed background information on pembrolizumab. The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway represents a major immune control switch which may be engaged by tumor cells to overcome active T-cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. In Kaposi sarcoma (KS) few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples has been recently reported (1). Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells in KS lesions (Caillat-Zucman, submitted). Consequently the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab may be useful to restore antitumoral immune response in KS.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Pembrolizumab will be administered intraveinously every 3 weeks, at the dose of 200 mg per infusion (see Chapter 7). Pharmacokinetic data analysis of pembrolizumab showed a typical profile as other IgGmAbs with a half- life of 2 to 3 weeks. Pharmacodynamic data suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q3W dosing schedule. The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate fixed dose is based on simulations performed using the population pharmacokinetic model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. The per protocol treatment duration is fixed to : Simon’s 2 stages Optimal Design : 6 months (8 cycles). Extension stage : 24 months (35 cycles) In case of severe adverse event or according to investigator decision, treatment will be stopped. In case of progression, treatment could be continued to allow delayed response after consultation with the principal investigator of the center and the investigator coordinator, and patient information. After at least 6 months of Pembrolizumab treatment, if the complete response is observed for at least 1 month, the Pembrolizumab will be stopped (for the Extension stage). This is a multicenter non-randomized phase II study. Patients will receive pembrolizumad/KEYTRUDA® 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for 8 cycles. Patients will receive pembrolizumad/KEYTRUDA® 200 mg IV every 3 weeks for 35 cycles. This is a multicentric French National study ..Number of centers: For the the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal stage: 8 For the Extension stage: 11 Recruitment and treatment delivery will be performed in an outpatient basis in the dermatology departments Different situations Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the subject's source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature termination of treatment, but the subject remains enrolled in the study, until the end of the subject's participation: the investigator must document the reason Premature termination of treatment and exit from the study. The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect all endpoints at the moment the subject from the study, if the subject agrees Schedule further follow-up visits, especially in case of a Serious Adverse Event. Subjects may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a subject 'from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the subject's best interests. Subject lost to follow-up: the subject cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the subject (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the subject is alive or dead If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraw consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used relating The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Other medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Pharmacodynamic and virological evaluations will be performed on sequential (before the first dose, at cycle 3, cycle 7 and at the end-of-study visit (early or expected termination). Peripheral blood will be collected (around 43 ml) at the 4 time points (before the first dose, at cycle 3, at cycle 7 and at the end-of-study visit) in 5 heparinate sample (total of 20 ml), 2 EDTA tube, 1 dry tube and one PAXgene tube . Skin biopsy will be collected at 3 time points: before the first dose, at cycle 3, and at the end-of-study visit (at 6 month or progression). Two 3mm punch biopsy samples will be performed on a Kaposi lesion: one is flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, the other is fixed in formalin or AFA). During follow up biopsy should be performed on residual disease, if possible of a same Kaposi lesion, if not of another lesion contiguous to the first lesion. For the Extension Stage, a peripheral blood and skin biopsy will be collected during ollow p if disease progression observed",
        "OBJECTIVES": "Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design: The main objective is to assess whether pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA® is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<5%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>30%) in classic and endemic Kaposi’s sarcoma, using the Simon’s 2 stage Optimal Design. Extension stage: In case of truly active conclusion of the Simon’s 2 stages Optimal Design, an extension stage would be performed. 20 more patients will be included to assess with a greater precision the estimation of the treatment effect at 6 months. The primary endpoint of this stage will be the Best overall response rate according to the ACTG criteria. Patient included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design, will be also followed until 24 months. We want to explain the efficacy of pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA® and measure the pharmacodynamics of this drug. We will also assess the safety of pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA®. Collateral research will be performed to measure the pharmacodynamics of pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA®. An immunomonitoring will be based on sequential tumor biopsies and peripheral blood in order to: Characterize the immune tumor infiltrate (immune cells quantification, immune check points expression) and the expression of PDL1/2 on tumor cells before and after treatment Analyze the immunomodulation (T and NK cells) induced by the treatment Identify immune markers of clinical response to the treatment. During treatment, the HHV8 viral load and the HHV8 expression profiles will be monitored in blood and tumor cells.",
        "METHODOLOGY": "The primary endpoint will be the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response following ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months. Refer to Section 8.1 Description of parameters of efficacy. Secondary objectives are: To assess the safety profile of pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA® in classic and endemic KS, To characterize the efficacy of pembrolizumab/KEYTRUDA®. 1/ Efficacy endpoints Different aspects of clinical response will be evaluated: Best overall response rate according to Physical Global Assessment (PGA) score until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months. Response rate at Month 3 and Month 6 according to ACTG and PGA criteria Response rate on number of lesions at Month 3, Month 6 and at best response as defined following  ACTG criteria Response rate on the size of target lesions at Month 3, Month 6 and at best response as defined following ACTG criteria Response rate on tumor infiltration of target lesions at Month 3, Month 6 and at best response as defined following ACTG criteria Response rate on lymphedema (circumference, scale of 0 (absence) to 3 (painful or oozing)) at Month 3, Month 6 and at best response as defined following ACTG criteria Time to response defined as the time to first response recorded from the start of treatment Time to progression Duration of response defined as the time from starting treatment to progression in patients achieving partial or complete response (See Chapter 8.1 for ACTG and PGA criteria) 2/ Safety endpoints Safety will be assessed in terms of drug toxicity evaluated by clinic and on laboratory parameters, and scored according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html) during all the study. 3/ Pharmacodynamic and virological analyses The immunological sub-study will include: Characterization of the tumor microenvironnement by immunohistochemistry: immune cells infiltration (quantification of CD3, CD4, CD8 T cells and CD56 NK cells, analysis of their expression of PD1 and other immune check points); markers of cytotoxicity (granzyme); expression of PDL1/2 on tumor cells. Analysis of the immunomodulation induced by the treatment on peripheral blood: T cells (CD4, CD8, anti-HHV-8 T cells) and NK cells phenotypes (flow cytometry, PBMCs: activation, exhaustion, immune check point expression); blood inflammation markers (luminex, plama). Virological analyses: The HHV8 viral load will be quantified in blood and tumor sample using quantitative real time PCR. Polymerase chain reaction amplification assay for HHV-8 DNA detection will be performed using on whole blood and biopsy specimens. DNA will be extracted using a DSP DNA Mini kit on a QiaSymphony system (Qiagen, Courtabeuf, France). Real-time quantitative amplification will be carried out on a ABI 7500 system (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). Dilutions of known amounts (10- 107 copies) of a fragment of viral DNA cloned into a plasmid were used to establish a standard curve. HHV-8 loads will be normalized according to the quantity of cells present in the sample by the quantification of Albumin gene using a real time PCR assay. HHV8 expression profiles will be determined on samples with loads above 4 log10 copies/106 cells using a micro-array targeting all KHV gene transcripts as described (16). For expression analysis, biopsy samples will be stored in RNAprotect medium right after collection and blood samples will be collected in PAXgene tubes. The primary endpoint of this stage will be the best overall response rate according to the ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months. Refer to Section 8.1 Description of parameters of efficacy and notably the complete response definition.",

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "The persons responsible for the quality control of clinical studies (Article L.1121-3 of the French Public Health Code) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to the investigational medicinal products, the study, the study participants and in particular the identity of the participants and the results obtained. These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the French Criminal Code). During or after the clinical study, all data collected about the study participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be be anonymised. Under no circumstances should the names and addresses of the subjects involved be shown. Only the subject's initials will be recorded, along with an identification code specific to the study indicating the order of enrolment. The sponsor will ensure that each subject has agreed in writing for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed. Data entry will be carried out on paper CRF. All information required according to the protocol must be entered in the CRFs. All other information will be reported on medical record. The data must be collected as and when they are obtained, and clearly recorded in these case report forms. Each missing data item must be coded. This digital case report form will be implemented in each of the centers thanks to a web-based data collection medium.",
        "STATISTICAL": "This is a multicenter non-randomized phase II study, based on a 2-stage phase II Simon’s Optimal Design. The main end point is the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response following ACTG criteria recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months Description As a general strategy, continuous efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using summary measures (median and interquartile range). Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be used to summarize categorical endpoints. Similarly, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categoriel characteristics). 2-stage phase II Simon’s Optimal Design: o Interim analysis The interim analysis will be based on the first successively included 9 patients, when their response will be recorded (at most 6 months after study inclusion). According to the design exposed above, interim analysis of efficacy will be based on the observation of responses. Based on our hypotheses, it was computed that 9 patients would be accrued in stage 1. If necessary, inclusion will be stopped during 6 months after the 9th inclusion waiting for the primary endpoint. The trial will stop with conclusion of inactivity if no response is observed in this stage; otherwise, 8 additional patients will be recruited to a total sample size of 17 patients, with at least 3 responses to indicate that the drug is effective enough. In case an observed response before the end of stage 1 the stage 2 will directly begin without any stop. o Terminal analysis: Terminal analysis will be done once all patients have been included, and data quality checked. It will be based on intent-to-treat principle, that is, all patients will be analysed whatever the treatment has been administered or not unless consent withdrawal. Point estimates with 95% exact confidence intervals will be computed either for efficacy or safety criteria. Distribution of time to response and time to progression will be estimated by the Kaplan Meier approach, unless competing events precluding their occurrence (deaths); in the latter case, cumulative incidence in a competing risks setting will be used. Extension stage Terminal analysis will be done once all patients have been included in the extension stage, and data quality checked. It will be based on intent-to-treat principle, that is, all patients will be analysed whatever the treatment has been administered or not unless consent withdrawal. Point estimates with 95% exact confidence intervals will be computed either for efficacy or safety criteria. Distribution of time to response and time to progression will be estimated by the Kaplan Meier approach, unless competing events precluding their occurrence (deaths); in the latter case, cumulative incidence in a competing risks setting will be used. The main analysis for the extension stage will be performed on the patients newly included in this stage. A secondary analysis will be performed on the patients included in the extension stage pooled with the patients included in the Simon’s 2-stage Optimal Design. Analyses will be performed on SAS (SAS Inc, cary, NC) and/or R (http://www.R-project.org/) software packages."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Treatment of severe refractory systemic lupus erythematosus by injection of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells derived from the umbilical cord\nAcronym: MSC-SLE\nCoordinating Investigator: Professor Dominique FARGE-BANCEL\nInternal Medicine : Auto-Immune Diseases and Vascular Pathology, UF 04 Hôpital St-Louis\n1, avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris 75010 Paris\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons) heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory Disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monocolonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.\nScientific justification: According to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair mechanisms, Mesenchymal Stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD, including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College London for cell manufacturing.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: \nTo assess the tolerance of allogeneic umbilical cord derived MSC administration for severe SLE refractory to standard therapies (cyclophosphamide mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids with or without anti CD20) \nPrimary endpoint: Immediate tolerance as assessed during the first injection and 10 days after the allogeneic MSC injection, according to standards CTCAE side effects.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives :\nFeasibility of allogeneic UC-MSC administration in the treatment of severe SLE subjects refractory to conventional therapies \nTolerance three months after injection, considering the observed morbidity and the overall survival in SLE treated subjects until 1 year after the procedure.\nAnalysis of biological and clinical response on routine clinical and biological examination and criteria for monitoring lupus using   SELENA SLEDAI-, BILAG, SF36, EQ5D, SRI, SLICC-SLE scores.\nAnalysis of the efficacy at 3-months after injection of allogeneic UC-MSCs according to the proportion of subjects with Major Clinical Response (RCM).\nPercentage of subjects with Partial Clinical Response (CPR) during the 12 months of follow-up study.\nEvaluation of the immunomodulatory effect of MSC by :\nRoutine laboratory criteria, including immunophenotyping, every 3 months during the follow-up period\nAnalysis of specific cytokine production at M0, M1 and M3.\nAnalysis of MSC immunogenicity at M0, M1 and M3\nSecondary endpoints :\nSafety Tolerance will be assessed during the injection and within the first 10 days following the MSC injection, at M1, M3, M6 and M12 according to side effects defined by CTCAE standards (Miller Results of cancer treatment Cancer 1981; 47 (1): 207 - 214).

Subjects may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a subject from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the subject's best interests. Subject lost to follow-up: the subject cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the subject (and record his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the subject is alive or dead If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Other medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up The investigator should initially complete a SAE reporting form (contained in the case report form). This report must be signed by the investigator. The investigator must complete every section of the SAE form so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate assessment. The initial report sent to the sponsor must be rapidly followed up by one or more additional written reports describing the course of the event and any complementary information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be anonymized. In addition, the investigator must state the study acronym and the number and initials of the study participant on each paper. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has terminated his participation in the trial. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be completed and signed as soon as the investigator becomes aware of the SAE without delay to the Safety Department of the DRCI by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor’s safety department. It is possible to send the SAE to the Safety department by fax to the sponsor’s safety department, fax No. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE by e-mail and in order to avoid duplicates. For trials which use CRF the investigator completes the SAE report form, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by fax or by email; The investigator must comply with all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. Procedures for reporting biovigilance to the sponsor Définitions According to Article R12-31 of the French Public Health Code: Incident : Accident or error related to the activities relating to the elements, products or derivatives mentioned in item 1 of I of article R. 1211-29 resulting or likely to result in: a) An adverse reaction in the persons mentioned in item 30 (I) of Article R. 1211-29; b) A loss of the element, product or derivative; c) A defect in the quality or safety of the element, product or derivative. Serious incident : a) Any incident causing or likely to result in: - a serious adverse reaction or an unexpected adverse reaction in the persons mentioned in item 30 of I of Article R. 1211-29; - any significant loss of the element, product or derivative preventing the graft from being performed or the administration of the product; b) Any unusually high incidence of incidents or expected adverse reactions; c) Any information concerning the donor or the donation, discovered incidentally after collection and the consequences of which are likely to entail a risk to the health of patients and recipients. Obligation of health professionals (investigator, “Correspondant Local de Biovigilance”, producer or head of cell therapy unit) Any health professional who is aware of a serious incident must report it to the sponsor without delay as soon as he becomes aware. It may be the investigator, the producer, the head of Cell Therapy Unit or the “Correspondant Local de Biovigilance” (CLB). It complements the specific section of the observation booklet (CRF). In case of a serious incident, the health professional completes the biovigilance form (see appendix 3 to the protocol)  and signed as soon as the investigator becomes aware of the SAE without delay to the Safety Department of the DRCI by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor’s safety department. It is possible to send the SAE to the Safety department by fax to the sponsor’s safety department, fax No. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE by e-mail and in order to avoid duplicates. In all cases, it is not necessary to have all the elements expected in the investigation of the incident or adverse reaction to report to the sponsor. Additional information will be sent further as necessary. Any useful documents (hospitalization report, batch release form, chimerism results) should be forwarded to the sponsor whenever possible. If the sponsor requests additional information, the “Correspondant Local de Biovigilance” or other health professional in his / her absence shall carry out the appropriate investigations and inform the sponsor of the results of the investigations. The “Correspondant Local de Biovigilance” will be responsible for reporting to the Agence de la Biomédecine ((French health competent authority for biovigilance)) any serious incidents and for informing potentially affected health professionals (other CLBs in other institutions, vigilant in Other fields ...).

        "METHODOLOGY": "Immediate tolerance will be assessed during the injection and within the first 10 days following the MSC injection, according to side effects defined by CTCAE standards (Miller Results of cancer treatment Cancer 1981; 47 (1): 207 - 214). Treatment-related toxicity will be analyzed according to the international World Health Organization (WHO) (maximum degree of toxic attacks by the body). An injection will be considered as not tolerated for any toxicity criteria above grade ≥ 3 (Tugwell P et al, Omeract OMERACT trials 2007). This ten-day primary endpoint was chosen in an analogy with another phase I / II cell therapy trial currently underway (PHRC AOM 11 250) and analyzing \"the tolerance of allogeneic MSC administration in the treatment of SSc diffuses severe or rapidly progressive and refractory to the conventional treatments by cyclophosphamide previous \"for which the prior authorization of the ANSM was obtained on this same criterion. It seemed important to homogenize the practices, the criteria of judgment and ultimately the analyzes. Moreover, following this remark, we decided to explicitly continue the analysis of tolerance by adding secondary endpoints of tolerance during the course of M1, M3, M6 and M12. Safety Tolerance will be assessed, at M1, M3, M6 and M12 according to side effects defined by CTCAE standards (Miller Results of cancer treatment Cancer 1981; 47 (1): 207 - 214).

These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the French Criminal Code). During and after the clinical study, all data collected about the study participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be anonymised. Under no circumstances will the names and addresses of the subjects be shown. The sponsor will ensure that each subject has agreed in writing for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed. e.g. Paper CRF : Data will be entered in duplicate in anonymised data entry forms. This will be done by dedicated Research personnel, Hospital Clinical Research Assistant and the Coordinating Investigator. A register of eligible patients will be required separately. Contact information’s of the patients will be kept in the medical file, but will not be saved in the computerized database. All information required by the protocol must be provided in the Case Report Form and an explanation given by the investigator for each missing data. The data must be transferred in the CRF as they are obtained, whether it is clinical or paraclinical data. The data must be copied from a net and readable manner in black ink in these CRFs (this is to facilitate duplication and computer input). Detected erroneous data on the Case Report Form will be clearly barred and new data will be copied on the CRF with the initials and the date by the member of the investigator’s team who made the correction. The anonymity of the patients will be insured by a code number and the initials of the person who lends itself to the research on all the documents necessary for the research, or by deleting by appropriate means of personal data on copies of source documents, intended for documentation of the research. Computerized data on a file shall be declared to the CNIL under the procedure adapted to the case.",
        "STATISTICAL": "Statistical analysis will be conducted by Pr Matthieu Resche-Rigon, from the Clinical Research Unit of St Louis-Lariboisière Hospital group, after Data collection and quality control. Statistical analysis will be performed sequentially, after observation of the main criterion (i.e., the proportion of patients in whom the procedure is not tolerated at dose 1 x 106 MSC per kg of weight of receiver, i.e., up to 10 days maximally after inclusion) of each included patient. It is to estimate the probability of intolerance using a Bayesian, from a beta-binomial model approach [51, 111]. The Bayesian approach is to consider the rate of intolerance (p) as a random, centered priori density variable on the expected rate of immediate intolerance (20%), which will be updated sequentially as the observations into a so-called law a. ex post Priori density will be chosen in the family of combined laws Beta, defined by its two parameters a and b (with a hope =  and a variance = ). The Bayes of intolerance rate estimator will be hope of the act retrospectively, i.e., the Beta of the parameters Act has An et Bn, defined from those of the prior Act and the number of n inclusions, as follows : An=a+r et Bn=b+n-r, where r is the number of tolerance observed included n. We have the following estimator:  . Stop Bayesian rules will be calculated sequentially and after the inclusion of the first 5 patients at the dose of 2 x 106 MSC per kg of weight of receiver, to eventually take a decision to stop the inclusions and/or increase (4.106 MSC per kg of weight of receiver) or decrease (1.106 MSC per kg of weight of receiver) dose from the two following criteria [43]: Criterion 1 = probability a posteriori intolerance π rate is greater than 20% (the threshold of intolerance considered) Criterion 2 retrospectively = probability that the rate of intolerance π is less than 20% (the threshold of intolerance considered) Judgment decisions are as follows: If criterion 1 > 0.70: judgment of inclusions at this dose and reduction dose for 5patients, following If criterion 2 > 0.70: judgment of inclusions at this dose and increase the dose for 5patients following The main motivation for choosing a sequential and Bayesian strategy was to provide continuous monitoring of the results throughout the trial and to ensure patient protection from overly toxic treatment. As the results of the patients in the trial are recorded, the posterior distribution of the probability of toxicity will be updated by applying the Bayes theorem. Depending on this later distribution, criteria can be used to modify the doses administered. The choices of the different thresholds are the results of discussions between the clinicians involved in the study and the methodologists in charge of the design of the study. The starting hypothesis is that the increase of the dose potentially implies an increase of the expected effect but also of the toxicities. It was considered that considering the pathology, complications of other treatments and the expected toxicities following stem cell injection a maximum of 20% intolerance / toxicity was reasonable. Let t be the probability of intolerance / toxicity, criterion 1 corresponds to the a posteriori probability that the intolerance rate t is greater than 20%, ie P (t> 0.2); Criterion 2 to the a posteriori probability that the intolerance rate π is less than 20%, ie P (t <0.2). It was decided to take a threshold ensuring easily a de-escalation of doses in case of suspicion of possible on toxicity. So as soon as this P (t> 0.2)> 0.7 the dose of stem cells is decreased. The usual thresholds for stopping or falling rules are usually higher (around 0.9; Yao, B., Zhu, L., Jiang, Q., & Xia, HA (2013). Clinical trials, Pharmaceutics, 5 (1), 94-106.) \"; But the choice of a lower value quickly avoids the risk of exposure to doses that are too high. Conversely, for criterion 2, a low probability (less than 0.3) of observed toxicity greater than 0.2 (P (t <0.2) = 1- P (t> 0.2) therefore criterion 2 corresponds to P t> 0.2) <0.3) will increase the dose and thus allow the patient to benefit from a larger quantity of stem cells. If none of the criteria is filled with patients will be included in the same starting dose, i.e. to 2.106MSC/kg. An independent Committee will meet in order to validate the decision to stop the inclusions, decrease the dose or to increase it in the light of the results of sequential analysis."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Randomized prospective trial evaluating the efficacy of the antiCD38 monoclonal antibody isatuximab in the treatment of PCRA by major ABO mismatch after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\nAcronym/reference: ERYTHROSIM\nCoordinating investigator: Dr XHAARD Aliénor\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: A quarter of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are performed in a situation of major ABO mismatch exposing patients to the risk of immunological pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after transplant.  PCRA after transplant is defined as anemia with low reticulocytes count (under 10 G/L) after day 60 despite good leucocytes and platelet engraftment, full donor chimerism, associated with the persistence of recipients hemagglutinins (anti-A or anti-B antibodies). Bone marrow evaluation when performed show erythroid hypoplasia. Red blood cells transfusions are necessary every two weeks until remission leading to impaired quality of life (anemia, repeated hospitalization), iron overload, and need for iron chelation therapy. Treatments currently used are inefficient (anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies, EPO, steroids, plasma exchanges, proteasome inhibitors) or at risk of severe acute GVHD (donor lymphocytes infusion). PRCA has been demonstrated to be associated with the persistence of recipient’s plasma cells.\nAnti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies which targets plasma cells secreting hemagglutinins responsible of PCRA are a promising treatment: 6 cases reported in the literature support a rapid and sustain efficacy (Chapuy, NEJM, 2018 Bathini, AmJHematol, 2019, Rautenberg, BMT, 2019 Salas et al. Eur J Haematol 2019, Preethi et al. Blood Cell Mol Dis 2020, Yates et al. Transfusion 2021)) but a prospective randomized evaluation of its efficacy and safety in this context is necessary.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: Efficacy of the treatment of PRCA by isatuximab after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared to supportive care only control group (reduction in PRCA resolution time in days)\n\nPrimary endpoint: \nTime to obtention of transfusion independence for patients with PRCA: time interval between randomization (corresponding to the M6 post-transplant) and resolution of PRCA (date of resolution of reticulocytopenia) treated or not by the anti-CD 38 monoclonal antibody isatuximab.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives\n1/ To evaluate the two arms in term of clinical and biological outcomes: \nReduction of red blood cells transfusion needs with Isatuximab \nEvolution of iron overload\nAdverse events related to Isatuximab in the context of allogeneic SCT (CTC-AE grade ≥ 2 in each group after M6 post-transplant)\nQuality of life: functional repercussions of chronic anemia, iterative transfusions and iron overload at d29, 3, 6, 9 months after randomization\nOverall survival and without relapse at M6, M9, M12 and M15 post-transplant\n2/ To identify prognostic factors of spontaneous resolution of PRCA by major ABO mismatch between D60 and M6 (type of donor, cell stem cell and conditioning regimen, occurrence of acute or chronic graft versus host disease, discontinuation of immunosuppression)\n3/ To evaluate the interest of follow-up of group hemagglutinins \n4/ To compare both arms in term of-cost effectiveness (cost of isatuximab treatment, hospitalizations, transfusion support and chelation treatments)\n\nSecondary Endpoints: \n-Number of red blood cell transfusions after randomization\n-Ferritin levels at M6, M9 and M15 post-transplant\n-Adverse events (CTC-AE grade ≥ 2) after randomization \n-Quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30- v3) at D60, D100, M6, M9, M12, M15 post-transplant\n-Factors associated with spontaneous resolution of PRCA between D60 and M6 post-transplant \n- Antibody level (anti A and/or anti B titers) at D60, D100, M6 post-transplant then at each visit d15, d29, d45, and M3, M6, M9 post randomization,\n- Number of days of hospitalization, transfusions support and chelation treatments\nDesign of the study: Randomized prospective Phase II clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of the antiCD38 antibody Isatuximab in patients with persistent PRCA at 6 months after allogeneic HSCT. Including patients at day 60 after transplant will help to define the factors associated with unresolved PRCA to M6 and thus identify patients that could benefit of Isatuximab treatment earlier in the future.\nInterim analysis will be performed after observations of 22 events (primary endpoint) in the trial.\nCategory: Cat 2: Phase 2\nPopulation of study participants: Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient 15 years of age or older with PRCA\nInclusion criteria: Patients:\nAged 15 years or older \nHaving receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in condition of major ABO mismatch\nPCRA defined by persistent red blood cell transfusion dependence at day 60 post-transplant with reticulocytes count under 10 G/L despite full donor chimerism and a good leucocytes (>1 G/L) and platelet (>50G/L) recovery\nNo relapse or progression of underlying disease\nContraception methods must be prescribed during all the duration of the clinical trial and using effective contraceptive methods during treatment for women of childbearing age (continue abstinence from heterosexual intercourse is accepted) and for man during the study treatment period and for at least 5 months after the last dose of study treatment and refrain from donating sperm during this period\nWith health insurance coverage\nHaving signed a written informed consent (2 parents for patients aged less than 18)\nExclusion criteria: Patients:\nAged < 15 years\nRelapse of underlying disease\nLeucocyte chimerism < 95%\nPRCA related to  Parvovirus B19 infection (positive blood PCR)\n- Known to be HIV+ or to have hepatitis A, B, or C  active infection \n- Active tuberculosis \n- Pregnancy (βHCG positive) or breast-feeding. \n- Patient receiving recombinant human erythropoietin.\n- Patient receiving proteasome inhibitor (Bortezomib for example).\n- Patient receiving thrombopoietin receptor agonists (ARTPO).\n- Patient receiving plasma or plasmapheresis exchanges after transplant.\n - Planned to receive any investigational drug within 14 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer.\n- Any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical conditions that, in the Investigator's opinion, would expose excessive risk to the patient or may interfere with compliance or interpretation of the study results.\n- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or history of intolerance to steroids, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, sodium stearyl fumarate, histidine (as base and hydrochloride salt), arginine, hydrochloride, poloxamer 188, sucrose or any of the other components of study therapy that are not amenable to premedication with steroids and H2 blockers or would prohibit further treatment with these agents.\n- Who have any debilitating medical or psychiatric illness\n- Under tutorship or curatorship  \n- Who not understand informed consent for an optimal treatment and follow-up\nExperimental treatment: Isatuximab treatment at a dose of 10 mg/kg by intravenous route.

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) through major ABO mismatch is observed in 10% of transplanted patients with a major ABO mismatch (donor A, B or AB and recipient have anti-A and/or anti-B isohemagglutinins). It is commonly defined as the persistence of an erythroblastopenia (reticulocytes lower than 10 G/L, despite a predominantly donor leukocyte chimerism) at 60 days from the transplant. As patients presenting a PRCA through major ABO mismatch do not produce any red blood cells, transfusions are needed at a rate of two packs of red blood cells every 14 days on average. In 50% of patients, evolution is favorable between day 60 and day 180 due to the natural disappearance of plasma cells producing these antibodies. Other patients will be transfused for a few months to a few years in extreme cases. Repeated transfusions are associated with an allo-immunization risk, potentially leading to a transfusional deadlock. Other side effects of repeated transfusions are a significant iron overload, requiring chelators (and phlebotomies upon resolution), sometimes with side effects, an alteration of quality of life (repeated day hospitalizations, asthenia arising from chronic anemia, liver damage, heart failure and endocrinological problems if there is a large iron overload) and extra costs. Treatments evaluated in Anglophone literature – strong doses of corticoids, monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies, plasmapheresis, proteasome inhibitors – have not proven their efficacy and are responsible for significant side effects, notably increased immunodeficiency. Donor lymphocytes injections may be more effective, but are associated with a risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody isatuximab, which targets the CD38+ plasma cells responsible for the synthesis of anti-A and Anti-B isohemagglutinins, could reduce the timeframe for red blood cell recovery in these patients. The literature concerning the use of anti-CD38 antibodies in patients presenting post-transplant immune-mediated cytopenia (auto-immune hemolytic anemia or erythroblastopenia) that is unresponsive to other treatments supports a rapid response (median of one injection). This study therefore aims to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal anti-CD38 antibodies in patients with PRCA through persistent major ABO mismatch six months post-transplant, knowing that these patients, whether they have received treatment or not, have a median transfusional independence of nine months. The hypothesis is to reduce the time to resolution in the isatuximab group to six weeks.",
        "OBJECTIVES": "The main objective is to demonstrate an efficacy of the treatment of PRCA by isatuximab after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant compared to supportive care only control group (reduction in PRCA resolution time in days) The secondary objectives are to: - Evaluate the two arms in term of clinical and biological outcomes: Reduction of erythrocyte transfusion needs with Isatuximab Evolution of iron overload Adverse events related to Isatuximab in the context of allogeneic SCT (CTC-AE grade ≥ 2 in each group after M6 post-transplant) Quality of life: functional repercussions of chronic anemia, iterative transfusions and iron overload at d29, 3, 6, 9 months of M6 post-transplant Overall survival and without relapse at M6, M9, M12 and M15 post-transplant - Identify prognostic factors of spontaneous resolution of PRCA by major ABO mismatch between D60 and M6 (type of donor, cell stem cell and conditioning regimen, occurrence of acute or chronic graft versus host disease, early withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy) - Evaluate the interest of follow-up of group hemagglutinins - Compare both arms in term of-cost effectiveness (cost of isatuximab treatment, hospitalizations, transfusion support and chelation treatments)",
        "METHODOLOGY": "Time to transfusion independence for patients with PRCA: time interval between randomization (corresponding to the M6 post-transplant) and resolution of PRCA (date of resolution of reticulocytopenia) treated or not by the anti-CD 38 monoclonal antibody isatuximab.

        "PROCEDURE": "A therapeutic phase II multicenter, national, open, randomized in parallel group with 2/1 ratio (experimental treatment/no treatment). This is a national multi-center study including 22adult and pediatric transplant centers of the SFGM-TC. The arm of randomization will be assigned during the visit of randomization. Patients will be recruited from the adult and pediatric hematology departments affiliated with SFGM-TC that perform allo-HSCT. More than two thousand allo-HSCT are currently being performed in France. The inclusion period will be increased to include patients (even more than the 90 expected) until to randomize the 45 patients needed, notably if less than 50% of the 90 enrolled patients are still PRCA at M6. Different situations: - Temporary discontinuation of treatment, the investigator should document the reason for discontinuation and its recurrence in the subject's source file and the CRF - Early discontinuation of treatment, but subject remains in clinical trial, until the end of participation, investigator should document the reason - Early discontinuation of treatment and termination of clinical trial participation. The investigator must: o Document the reason(s) o Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees o Plan follow-up of the subject, especially in the event of a serious adverse event Detailed guidelines for the management of infusion reactions for isatuximab IV are provided in paragraph 7.1. In the case of serious adverse events, they should be reported by the investigator to the sponsor and followed up during the patient's protocol follow-up period. The notification of the serious adverse event will be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be tracked until it is resolved. If an independent monitoring committee has been set up, it may specify and/or validate the terms of the monitoring. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance. The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Follow-up of subjects following a discontinuation of participation in the clinical trial Discontinuation of a subject's participation will not change his or her usual take care to the disease. In the event of serious adverse events during early discontinuation of treatment and participation in clinical trial  by the patient: see paragraph 6.4.1. Procedures for the replacement of these subjects The analysis of the trial will be in intention to treat. Any patients included will be analyzed. There will therefore be no replacement procedure unless a patient's consent is withdrawn if the study inclusion period is still open. Full or partial discontinuation of the study AP-HP as sponsor or the Competent Authority can prematurely discontinue all or part of the study, temporarily or permanently, further to the recommendations of the Data Safety Monitoring Board in the following situations: first of all, if suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are observed in one of the treatment arms or if there is a discrepancy in the serious adverse reactions between the treatment arms, requiring a reassessment of the benefit-risk ratio for the study Similarly, AP-HP, as the sponsor, or the Competent Authority  may decide to prematurely discontinue the study due to unforeseen issues or new information about the product, in light of which the objectives of the study or clinical program are unlikely to be achieved. AP-HP as sponsor reserves the right to permanently suspend enrolment at any time if it appears that the inclusion objectives are not met. If the study is prematurely discontinued for safety reasons, the decision and justification will be provided by the sponsor (AP-HP) to the Competent Authority  and to the Research Ethics Committee without undue delay but not later than in 15 days of the date of the temporary halt or early termination. It shall include the reasons for such action and specify follow-up measures , along with recommendations from the Data Safety Monitoring Board in the case of substantial modification. The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilization at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, fetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.

        "STATISTICAL": "Analysis Populations The following analysis sets will be considered: Intent-to-treat analysis: all included patients will be considered in their randomization arms. This will refer for all to the primary analyses. Analysis per protocol: it will consider patients in the arm of the effectively received treatment. All analyses will be in ITT,  per-protocol analyses will be performed as a sensitivity analysis. As a general strategy, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categoriel characteristics) A flow chart will summarize all patients screened, included and analysed. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint The delays to obtention of transfusion independence for patients with PRCA will be compared using a logrank test. The impacts of resolutions will be estimated in each arm using the Kaplan Meier estimator with their 95% confidence intervals. Patients will be censored at the end of the follow-up. In case of a competing event occurring during follow-up (death without resolution), the logrank test will be replaced by a Gray test and the Kaplan Meier estimator by the Gray cumulative incidence estimator. Interim analysis will be performed after observations of 22 events (primary endpoint) in the trial. In case of significant logrank test at the interim analysis, trial will be stopped and final analyses performed. If the trial is still going on, the final p.value will be calculated using a combination of the p.values of the first step and of the second step using the Wassmer approach (Wassmer, Gernot. \"Planning and analyzing adaptive group sequential survival trials.\" Biometrical Journal: Journal of Mathematical Methods in Biosciences 48.4 (2006): 714-729.). Moreover, if requested by DSMB, sample size recalculation could be performed. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints - Number of red blood cells received as a result of the PCRA after randomization (M6 post- transplant in each group up to M15. The number will be described per arm (Median IQR) and compared between the arms using a Wilcoxon test. In the event of death, the number of units will be considered as maximum. - Date of last transfusion. The time to the last transfusion date will be compared between the arms using a logrank test. Patients will be censored at the end of the follow-up. In case of a competing event occurring during follow-up (death without stopping transfusions), the logrank test will be replaced by a Gray test. - Evolution of ferritin at M6, M9, and M15 of the transplant will be modelled using a random effect general linear regression model on the patient and a time effect. - Evaluation of adverse events of grade ≥ 2 observed in each group after randomization (M6 post-transplant). The SAE will be described in each arm and their frequencies compared using a Fisher test. - Quality of life assessment by the EORTC -C30-v3 to D60, M6, M9, M12 and M15 post-transplant questionnaires. It will be described in each arm (Median IQR). It will be modelled using a random effect general linear regression model on the patient and a time effect. - Overall survival and without relapse at M6, M9, M12 and M15 post-transplant will be estimated per arm using the Kaplan Meier estimator with their 95% confidence intervals. Patients will be censored at the end of the follow-up. They will be compared using Logrank test - Factors associated with spontaneous resolution of PCRA between D60 and M6 post-transplant will be explored using Cox's model. - Follow-up of plasma anti-A and/or anti-B antibody titers at D60, M6 post-transplant and then at each visit d15, d29, D45, and, 3, 6, 9 months after the randomization visit. They will be described in each arm (Median IQR). They will be modelled using a random effect general linear regression model on the patient and a time effect - Assessment of the costs of PCRA with or without Isatuximab treatment (the cost of treatment), day or full hospitalizations directly related to PCRA, erythrocyte transfusion support and necessary chelation treatments. The economic evaluation will assess the costs and effectiveness and safety of the treatments. The analysis will be conducted from a health system perspective over a 9-month period. All health resources necessary for treatment will be collected prospectively. They include inpatient and outpatient treatment, testing, consultations, imaging and home care. Health care costs will be estimated using a combination of resource and event-based methods. The total length of stay will be extracted from the hospital's information system for indexed admission and thus subsequent admissions related to the event during the 9-month follow-up period.  Hospitalization costs will be allocated according to the groups related to the severity diagnosis, adjusted according to the length of the stay. The cost of each admission will be estimated from the national cost study, using the actual length of stay and the daily cost. Non-hospital resources will be estimated from the eCRF, medical records (discharge orders) and interviews with patients during follow-up visits. In addition to the treatment, we will collect information on consultations, drugs, laboratory tests. Non-hospital resources will be assessed using the most recent price and rate schedule. The total average cost per patient will be calculated in each group; the 95% start-up interval will be estimated and costs compared using non-parametric tests)."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Evaluation of long-term health status and quality of life in adult survivors with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma treated with an intensive pediatric or pediatric-inspired-inspired protocol.\nAcronym: EQUAALL01\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr Nicolas BOISSEL\nHematology Department\nSaint-Louis Hospital\n+33142499643\nnicolas.boissel@aphp.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: The overall survival of adult patients (15-59y) with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LL) was dramatically improved by the use of full pediatric or pediatric-inspired protocols (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that aimed to reduce the risk of relapse by adopting more intensive chemotherapeutical schedule. This approach led to a global improvement in overall survival (5y-OS, 57%) whatever patient age but was responsible for an excess of treatment-related mortality in patients older than 45 years (5y-TRM in patients > 45y, 19%). Pediatric longitudinal studies pointed out that long term leukemia survivors have an increased risk of developing specific adverse events like dysmetabolic syndrome, obesity, decreased fertility, organ dysfunction, osseous events, or impaired cognitive functions. This study aims to evaluate the impact in term of long-term events and QoL in adult patients that received an intensified therapeutic approach recently implemented in adult cooperative groups.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: To evaluate the prevalence of late effects in adult patients treated 10 years ago for ALL/LL with an intensified pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRALLE2000) that exposed patients to increased cumulative doses of chemotherapy, central nervous system irradiation or w/o allogeneic transplant after total body irradiation-based regimen w/o boost irradiation on central nevous system.\nThe primary endpoint is thus defined by the prevalence of adverse events, including :\n- metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes) \n- osseous events / osteoporosis\n- cardiac and vascular troubles\n- neurologic troubles\n- lung dysfunctions\n- endocrinal troubles\n- ophthalmological troubles\n- fertility disorders\n- secondary neoplasia\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: - To evaluate the quality of life of these patients,\n- To correlate the prevalence of late effect or QoL status with previous social situation, previous medical condition to ALL. Treatment schemes including administration of protocols phases (delayed intensification, maintenance), central-nervous system irradiation, allogeneic SCT, graft-versus host disease occurrence. ,\n- To elaborate risk-adapted recommendations for the long-term follow-up of adult patients treated for ALL with reinforced therapeutic strategies.\nThe secondary endpoints are thus\n- the prevalence of metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes), \n- the prevalence of osseous events / osteoporosis,\n- the prevalence of cardiac and vascular troubles,\n- the prevalence of neurologic troubles, \n- the prevalence of lung dysfunctions, \n- the prevalence of endocrinal troubles,\n- the Quality of Life (SF-36)\n- the prevalence of ophthalmological troubles\n- the prevalence of fertility disorders\n- the prevalence of secondary neoplasia\nDesign of the study: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, interventional minimal risks and constraints human research study\nPopulation of study participants: Adult patients aged 15-59y at diagnosis treated ten years ago for a Ph1-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LL)\nInclusion criteria: - Patient with Philadelphia-negative ALL or LL treated in or according to a pediatric-like or pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL or FRALLE) with or without allogeneic transplant.\n- Patients older than 15 years old and less than 60 years old at diagnosis \n- Patient with a follow-up from first complete remission of more than 10 years,\n- Patient who gave informed signed consent for baseline examination\nExclusion criteria: - Patient who experienced ALL/LL relapse within the 5 past years.\n- Philadelphia positive ALL patients\nInterventions or product under investigation: None\nOther interventions added by the study: - hormons tests\n- antral follicle count by US\n- Questionnaire\nExpected benefits for the participants and for society: An expected individual benefit, since systematic reviews can be used to detect and take early care the late complications related to treatment\nMinimal risks and constraints added by the study: None\nScope of the study: Risk minimal (A)\nNumber of participants included: 300\nNumber of sites: Approximatively 36 centers of the GRAALL network\nSchedule for the study: State:\n- inclusion period: 66 months\n- participation period: 9  months\n- total duration of the study : 75 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 300 patients / 36 sites \n66 months inclusion period = <1 patients/month/ site\nStatistical analysis: The analysis will handle the left data truncation (given only patients who survive until 2016 are able to be included in the study).\nApproximately 1000 patients were included in the GRAALL-2003 and 2005, among them 630 before August 2009. \nConsidering that 363/630 patients were alive at last follow-up, the opportunity to include patients treated according to these protocols, and a 80% inclusion success, approximately 300 patients will be recruited.\nThis allows assessing the prevalence of troubles with a 95%CI width at 7% about assuming a 10% prevalence or to 0.10 assuming a 30% prevalence, and detection of OR at 2.5 or 2, respectively. This also allows reaching a statistical power of at least 80% for detecting OR at 2.\nSources of monetary support: Ministry of Health",
        "OBJECTIVES": "The primary objective of the EQUAALL study is to evaluate the global prevalence of late effects in adult patients treated 10 years ago with an intensified pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRAALL2000) that exposed patients to increased cumulative doses of chemotherapy, central nervous system irradiation or without allogeneic transplant after total body irradiation-based regimen w/o boost irradiation on central nevous system. The secondary objectives of the EQUAALL study are: to evaluate the quality of life of these patients, to correlate the prevalence of late effect or QoL status with previous or current social situation and previous medical condition to ALL. Treatment schemes including administration of protocols phases (delayed intensification, maintenance), central-nervous system irradiation, graft-versus host disease occurrence, allogeneic SCT. to elaborate risk-adapted recommendations for the long-term follow-up of adult patients treated for ALL with reinforced therapeutic strategies.",
        "METHODOLOGY": "This is a binary, composite, endpoint, defined by the Prevalence of adverse events, including any of the following adverse events: metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes) osseous events /osteoporosis cardiac and vascular troubles neurologic troubles lung dysfunctions endocrinal troubles ophthalmological troubles fertility disorders secondary neoplasia Prevalence of metabolic troubles (dysmetabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, diabetes) Prevalence of osseous events / osteoporosis Prevalence of cardiac and vascular troubles Prevalence of neurologic troubles Prevalence of lung dysfunctions Prevalence of endocrinal troubles Quality of Life (SF-36) Prevalence of ophthalmological troubles Prevalence of fertility disorders Prevalence of secondary neoplasia",
        "PROCEDURE": "This is a multicentre, cross-sectional, interventional study. All patients with Philadelphia negative ALL treated in according to the GRAALL2003/05-LL03-FRAALL2000 trials will be invited to participate to the study. All patients previously included in the GRAALL03/05 trials but also all patients treated according to these protocols will be considered for inclusion. Actually, these trials included 225 and 730 patients, respectively, with 94 and 276 patients who died during the study (Table 1). Table 1: Sample sizes and outcomes of patients included in the GRAALL03/05 trials Representativeness: The sample should be recruited so that the final proportions in each of these GRAALL network trials match the original trials. No attempt should be made to balance exactly across cross-stratifications, such as centre. Thus, a representative sampling to estimate potential accrual by phone call will be performed among the participating centres. Such a cross-sectional design is commonly used in epidemiologic studies. The advantage of such a design is that information on the whole patient history can be obtained at the time of the study, and that it does not require expensive follow-up of a cohort, especially for rare diseases. Moreover, as the patients have been included in standardized protocols, most of the exposure variables (including treatment exposures and potential confounders) are already available from the original trials, thus mostly avoiding recall bias. Note that, in such a clinical epidemiology setting, each patient from the study will benefit from the early diagnosis of health troubles that may benefit for a medical care. However, it is important to be aware of data truncation, as it distorts the data set and has potential to cause large biases. Indeed, in such a cross-sectional survey, both right and left truncation can occur, due to selection of patients at a random time after treatment. In particular, individuals with longer lifetimes are favoured by the sampling process. Thus, on one hand, patients who died from adverse events will not be sampled (left truncation), and on the other hand, patients with very late adverse events will be under-represented (right truncation). There is a way of avoiding truncation bias in the design of the study, which apply to cross-sectional studies. One is to collect data from patients who are old enough to have no more late adverse events, but this requires long-term recall. Alternatively, the bias can be handled in the analysis, by using statistical modelling. This will be used in this project (see Statistical Methods section). This study will be conducted among centers of the cooperative GRAALL network in which patients were initially treated. This network is used to federate clinical and translational, academic and industrial research programs.  It includes 36 centers. For this research, the subjects will be identified as follows: Centre No. (3 numerical positions) - Selection order No. of the person in the center (4 numerical positions) - surname initial - first name initial This reference is unique and will be retained for the entire research period. Enrolment period: 66 months Duration of participation by each patient: 9  months Total study duration: 75 months Once a patient is selected and informed, and if the patient agreed for participation to the protocol, the patient will be contacted for inclusion visit. During this visit the patient eligibility will be evaluated from inclusion and non-inclusion criteria. Once the consent will be signed by the patient and investigator, the patient will be included by connecting the eCRF. Selected patients who are unable to visit the site due to distance or relocation will be informed of the research by telephone. If the patient agrees to take part in the protocol, he or she will then receive the written information and consent form by post at his or her address and will be asked to sign and return it. Once the investigator has received this form, he will send a duplicate signed by both parties to the patient, and an appointment will then be made for the teleconsultation. The quality of life questionnaire (SF-36), and a stamped letter, will be sent to the patient for completion and return. The patient identification number will be allocated. The detailed data collection would be vital to characterize participants’ clinical and functional status, assess their current health, and identify cases of prevalent diseases. Actually, different measures will be performed if not realized in the year before except blood tests concerning the metabolic syndrom (< 6 months) within three months of study inclusion according to center’s policy. The antral follicle count US, AMH (in non menopausal females) and Questionnaires (QoL(SF-36) will be assess in investigator center during the inclusion visit because they are procedures added by the research. For measures and exams that will be performed outside of center the investigator will give a prescription to the patient. Then he or she will report or send the results to the investigator center. This study will be conducted among centers of the cooperative GRAALL network in which patients were initially treated or near from their present place of residence. This network is used to federate clinical and translational, academic and industrial research programs. The GRAALL network comprises 33 French centers involved in the treatment of acute leukemia. Each center will be responsible for the recruitment, the inclusion and the measurements performed in each enrolled patient. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant's best interests. If a participant exits the study prematurely, all data about that participant may be used until consent is withdrawn. If a participant exits the study prematurely, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment). State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant exited or was withdrawn from the study: Medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations.

        "ELIGIBILITY": "All patients will be included once all the eligibility criteria (all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria must be fulfilled) have been checked. All persons who had Philadelphia negative ALL or LL treated in or according to a pediatric-like or a pediatric-inspired protocol (GRAALL or FRALLE) with or without allogeneic transplant were older than 15 years old and less than 60 years old at diagnosis (ALL) had a follow-up from first complete remission of more than 10 years Patient who gave informed signed consent for baseline examination Patient who experienced ALL/LL relapse within the 5 past years.

        "STATISTICAL": "A cross-sectional survey collects data to make inferences about a population of interest (universe) at one point in time. The analysis will handle the data truncation (given only patients who survive and free of relapse until 2016 are able to be included in the study, and only adverse events that occur within the first years after the end of the protocol could be observed yet). The most common method of modelling binomial health data such as that related on the observation of any adverse event in cross-sectional studies has long been logistic analysis. We will model and estimate prevalence ratios with the 95% confidence interval (95%CI), instead of odds ratios, and search for potential risk factors using log-binomial models, as previously recommended in cross-sectional studies when diseases or injuries are not rare [Barros 2003; Petersen 2008]. However, due to the cross-sectional sampling, included patients, by virtue of having survived to the time of enrolment, could not have died between diagnosis and study enrolment, and therefore they should be removed from the risk set between those two time points. To leave them in the risk set would bias the survival estimates resulting in so-called left data truncation; in other words, if we were to estimate incidence of those adverse events from the time of first trial enrolment, we would observe a survival bias. Thus, nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) of the distribution function observed under truncation will be used [Efron 1999]. Finally, inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach will be used to causal inference purposes [Robins1999]. Analysis will be based on R software (http://www.R-project.org/), with packages survival [Therneau 2014], DTDA [Moreira 2010]. Barros AJ, Hirakata VN.

However, AHSCT is contra-indicated in case of advanced visceral involvement and in eligible patients, it is still associated with risk of toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective treatments for severe SSc. \nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells which carry immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties, that can target SSc pathogenesis and its clinical manifestations. The increasing use of MSC, harvested from bone marrow (MSC(M)), adipose tissue (MSC(AT)), or umbilical cord (MSC(UC)) in a variety of indications, provides consistent evidence supporting their safety in humans. The efficacy of MSC(M) intravenous (IV) injection for treating acute graft versus host disease led to their marketing approval in 2012 and MSC(AT) (Alofisel) were approved for severe Crohn’s fistula in 2018.\nMSC represent a promising therapeutic approach for SSc. We have previously a) shown disease-specific abnormalities in MSC(M) from SSc patients, providing strong rationale to use allogeneic MSC to treat SSc patients, b) published the first phase I/II dose escalation trial using allogenic MSC(M) infusion in 20 severe SSc patients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02213705, PHRC AOM 11-250) with no safety issues, significant improvement in skin fibrosis at 3 to 6 months after infusion which appeared lower thereafter, thereby supporting the need for repeated infusions.\nIn vitro, experimental and clinical studies suggest that MSC properties vary according to their tissue of origin/source. We demonstrated that compared to MSC(M), MSC(AT) are easier to harvest and display higher proliferative capability before entering senescence, higher genetic stability, and superior immunosuppressive properties. \nConsidering the above rationale, we hypothesize that use of healthy donors allogeneic MSC(AT) produced by Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS) will demonstrate a) no safety issues, b) an efficacy profile that will increase with repeated infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) to treat SSc\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: To evaluate the safety one month after allogeneic 2x106 MSC(AT)/kg intravenous administration once or twice at 3 months interval (M0, M3) in severe SSc patients\n\nPrimary endpoint: The rate of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (SAE) defined as Adverse Events (AE) of grade equal or above 3 using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 classification, at one month after each infusion (M1, M4). All adverse events will be adjudicated by a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives: \nSafety during the infusion, within the first 24 hours of infusion and during all study follow-up.\nEfficacy signals to inform future studies, using outcome measures on skin sclerosis, lung function and quality of life, previously validated in SSc or used in other cell therapy trials. \nAnalysis of the response to treatment, Progression-free survival (PFS), Global Rank Composite Score (GRCS) at M3, M6and M12 and ACR Provisional Composite Response Index for Clinical Trials in Early Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (CRISS) for early SSc patients at M3, M6 and M12.\nAnalysis of the overall survival and assess causes of death.\nImpact of allogeneic MSC(AT) iv once or twice at 3 months interval on the immune response, including immunophenotyping and alloimmunization up to M6 after starting therapy.\nCost effectiveness of the allogeneic MSC(AT) infusion once or twice versus no treatment in severe SSc patients.\n\nSecondary endpoints:\nRate of treatment-related SAE defined as AE of grade equal or above 3 CTCAE v5.0 at time and within the first 24 hours of infusion and during all follow-up at: M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12.\nMain efficacy endpoint: modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) difference between M0 and M12.\nOther efficacy disease related endpoints : \nmRSS at M3, M6 and M9\nWHO performance status (PS) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaires : Scleroderma-Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ), the Short Form (36) health survey (SF-36v2) and EQ-5D-5L at M0, M3, M6, and M12;\nForced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Diffusing capacity of Lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at M0, M6 and M12.\nResponse to treatment, defined as any of the following: decreased mRSS > 25%, increased FVC > 10% and/or increased DLCO>10%, without need for further immunosuppression except low dose steroids (below 10mg daily) at M3, M6 and M12. \nPFS at M12, with progression defined as any of the following: decreased in FVC > 10% or in DLCO > 15%; decrease in LVEF% > 15%; decrease in weight > 15%; decrease in creatinine clearance > 30%; increased mRSS > 25% ; and/or increase in SHAQ> 0.5.\nGRCS values at M3, M6 and M12.\nCRISS values for early SSc patients at M3, M6 and M12.\nOverall survival at M12\nMyeloid and lymphocyte sub-populations in all included patients at M0, M1, M3, M4, M6.\nAlloimmunization in all included patients through the detection and identification of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies at M0, M3 and M6.\nExtra-Cost per QALY (quality-adjusted Life Year) gained by unique and repeated IV infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) in severe SSc after 12 months.\nExtra-Cost per SAE of grade above or equal to 3 CTCAE avoided by unique and repeated IV infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) in severe SSc after 12 months.\nDesign of the study: Multi-centre, three-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase I-II trial\nCategory: Category 2\nPopulation of study participants: Adult patients with refractory severe systemic scleroderma\nInclusion criteria: Provide signed and dated informed consent;\nWilling to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the study; \nMale or female, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age \nSSc patients according to American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2013 classification criteria for SSc; \nSevere disease with either: \ndisease duration of 2 years or less with a modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) ≥ 20 and (abnormal CRP > 5 mg/l and/or hemoglobin < 11 g/dL), or \nmRSS ≥ 15 without any restriction as to disease duration plus at least one major organ involvement as defined by: \nrespiratory involvement consisting of lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and/or forced vital capacity (FVC) < 80% predicted and evidence of interstitial lung disease (chest X-ray and/or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan) and/or moderate  Pulmonary hypertension with baseline resting systolic pulmonary arterial pressures > 35 mmHg and below 50 mmHg by cardiac echocardiography, or mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20  mmHg and < 40 mm Hg on right heart catheterization;\nrenal involvement consisting of past  renal crisis, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and/or renal insufficiency not explained by other causes than SSc; \ncardiac involvement consisting of reversible congestive heart failure, atrial or ventricular rhythm disturbances such as recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter, recurrent atrial paroxysmal tachycardia, 2nd or 3rd degree AV-block, mild to moderate pericardial effusion and/or presence of MRI involvement  (Increased T1 or T2 mapping, late gadolinium enhancement, septal D sign) .

Results from the proposed trial will be used to inform a larger Phase II-III multi-center trial of MSC(AT) in SSc and other clinical trials in auto-immune diseases, with the potential to accelerate the treatment of SSc patients and to allow France playing a leadership role in regenerative medicine for AD and fibrotic diseases.\nRisks and burdens added by the study: The increasing use of MSCs in a wide variety of therapeutic indications currently provides a wealth of data in favour of their safety in humans. There are no foreseeable serious adverse effects associated with the injection of MSCs. \nSome transient benign adverse reactions, linked to the procedure for injecting the cells or the placebo, may occur.\nNumber of participants included: 18 patients\nNumber of centres: 1 centre for patients treatment :\nUnité de Médecine Interne: (UF 04), MATHEC, Centre de Référence des Maladies auto-immunes systémiques Rares d’Ile-de-France, Filière FAI2R, IRSL, URP 3518, Université de Paris, Hôpital St-Louis, AP-HP, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.

Grégory Pugnet, MD, PhD.\nDuration of the study: - Inclusion period: 12 months\n- Participation period (treatment + follow-up): 12 months plus possibly 3 months additional follow-up for patients in the placebo arm (arm 0) or arm 1 who will have chosen the opportunity to receive one or two MSC(AT) injection at the end of the study after unblinding and once evidence of MSC(AT) injection safety is provided (up to 2 months between unblinding and MSC(AT) injection).\nTotal duration: 29 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,5 inclusion, per site, per month\nStatistical analysis: We propose to conduct a multi-center, three-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We will enroll a total of 18 SSc patients. Each patient will be 1:1:1 randomized to one of two treatment arms (1 infusion of MSC (M0) or 2 infusions of MSC (M0, M3))or a placebo arm (total of 6 patients per arm, using randomization block of size 6).\nInclusions will be staggered, to allow the detection of SAE prior to inclusion of subsequent patients, according to the following waiting rules:\n- at least one week between two consecutive randomizations\n- interval of at least one month every three randomizations\n\nContinuous monitoring of the primary endpoint by the sponsor will be implemented to allow continuous Bayesian toxicity monitoring with a stopping rule implemented on the primary endpoint on cell infusions (see section 13 for details): \n- first analysis on the first 3 patients with completed M1 visits, \n- then analysis at any TRSAE at M1 or M4 visits\n- final analysis.\n \nThe stopping rule will be defined based on the estimated probability that the risk of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (TRSAE) is >15%. “criterion 1” = the probability that the a posteriori probability of SAE is > 15%. The posterior probability of TRSAE (πtrsae) will be estimated using a Bayesian approach with a beta density. The stopping rule will be fulfilled if criterion 1 > 0.70 (meaning that we have a high probability that there is a greater than 15% risk of TRSAE). Interim analyses results will be presented to the DSMB for their recommendation.  In the case of early stopping, subsequent patients will not be randomized and all patients treated thus far will be followed up and results analyzed as described below. \nThere is no formal statistical test for sample size in a Bayesian framework. Nevertheless, one can invoke the frequentist framework to anticipate the expected precision in terms of safety. Indeed, after 18 infusions (6 patients with 1 infusion, 6 patients with 2 infusions), we will be able to estimate a risk of Severe Adverse Events (SAE) of 10% with a width of the exact 95% confidence interval equal to 32% considering independence between infusions.\nStudy will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board: YesThe Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be composed of 3 external reviewers with expertise in SSc, MSC and early phase trials. In case of any safety data reported to the Safety department, the DSMB will be informed, hold meeting and determine whether the trial should be held or proceed.",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "In vitro, experimental and clinical studies suggest that MSC properties vary according to their tissue of origin/source. We demonstrated that MSC(AT) compared to MSC(M) are easier to harvest and display higher proliferative capability before entering senescence, higher genetic stability, and superior immunosuppressive properties. We have completed the first phase I/II dose escalation trial using allogenic MSC(M) infusion in 20 severe SSc patients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02213705) with no safety issues, and found significant improvement in skin fibrosis at 3 months after infusion which appeared lower thereafter (65), thereby supporting the need for repeated infusions. To accelerate the clinical translation of MSC(AT) as a therapeutic cell product in SSc, we propose to test the safety of MSC(AT) in SSc and to seek evidence for a possible efficacy signal in this Phase I/II trial. Considering the above rationale, we hypothesize that use of healthy donor allogeneic MSC(AT) produced by EFS will demonstrate a) no safety issues, b) an efficacy profile that will increase with repeated infusion at 3 months interval of allogeneic MSC(AT) to treat SSc.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Allogeneic Adipose tissue derived-MSCs (MSC(AT)) or placebo will be injected by slow intravenous infusion at 3-5 ml/mn with a minimum infusion time of 16 min via a 200 µm transfusion filter. The MSC(AT) bags of cell suspension will all be prepared according to the recipient body weight and to the study experimental arms: arm 0: placebo at M0 and M3 arm 1: 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 placebo injection at M3 arm 2: 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M3 We propose to conduct a multicenter Phase I/II, three-arm, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. 18 SSc patients will be 1:1:1 randomized (with randomization blocks of size 6) in one of the following arms: arm 0: placebo at M0 and M3 arm 1:1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 placebo injection at M3 arm 2: 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M3 Second infusions will be performed only in the absence of previous treatment-related SAE (TRSAE), as defined in primary endpoint. Continuous monitoring of the primary endpoint by the sponsor will be implemented to allow continuous Bayesian toxicity monitoring with a stopping rule implemented on the primary endpoint (see section 13 for details): - first analysis on the first 3 patients with completed M1 visits, - then analysis at any TRSAE at M1 or M4 visits - final analysis Patients and medical team will be blinded to treatment arm. Blinding will only be broken if 1) presumably related SAEs occurred and if the investigators want to know the assigned treatment for proper clinical management; or 2) it is required by local regulatory authorities. Figure 1. Trial design. 1:1:1 randomized design, with 3 randomization blocks of size 6, staggered inclusions in cohorts of 3 patients (≥1 week between each patient and ≥1 month interval every three patients), continuous toxicity Bayesian monitoring with toxicity stopping rule (first analysis on the first 3 patients with cell infusions (Arms 1 and 2) completed M1 visits, then at any TRSAE at M1 or M4 visits, and final analysis). n0 is the total number of patients in Arm 0, n1 in Arm 1 and n2 in Arm 2; n is the number of patients per arm per randomization block. Arm 0 = placebo at M0 and M3 ; Arm 1= MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 placebo injection at M3; Arm 2=1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M0 and 1 MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at M3. Patients included in arm 1 and in arm 0 will have the opportunity,according to their willingness, to receive either 1 (arm 1) or 1 or 2 (arm 0) MSC(AT) (2x106 cells/kg) injection at the end of the study after unblinding and once evidence of MSC(AT) injection safety is provided. In that case patients will be followed as usual care up to three more months. This multi-centre study will involve 2 different hospitals within the MATHEC network, “ Filière des maladies auto-immunes et auto-inflammatoires rares” (FAI2R), under the auspices and the good clinical practices of the “Société Francophone de Greffe de Moelle et Thérapie Cellulaire” (SFGM-TC). Recruitment and following centres The participants will be recruited in hospital (consultation or hospitalisation or outpatients) from 2 different sites and followed in their recruiting centre.

In the case of public announcements and advertisements, documents will be submitted to the CPP (Research Ethics Committee) for approval along with the protocol. 18 participants will be included during the enrolment period (12 months). 0,5 participants will need to be enrolled per site per month, based on the number of sites and the duration of the enrolment period. Table 9 : Summary table of the recruitment subjects per site and per month In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 12 months following the premature discontinuation of treatment. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. In case of any safety data reported to the Safety department, the DSMB will be informed, hold meeting and determine whether the trial should be held or proceed. Second infusions will not be performed in the presence of treatment-related SAE after the first injection. Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature termination of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly if there in case of a serious adverse event. . In case of patient withdraw during the inclusion period, replacement will be performed. The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Vigilance Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99, only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). When sending the email, please: Adopt a standardized nomming of the email subject in the following form: <<   Objet : YYYYYY_XXXXXX_jjmmaaaa (avec YYYYYY : code de la recherche, XXXXXX : acronyme de la recherche et jjmmaaaa : date de transmission).  >> - Send a SAE initial notification form and/or a follow-up report concerning a single participant for a given SAE, attachment may contain one (or more) document(s) (follow-up and hospitalization reports, for example). The total size of the email must be less than 8 MB, otherwise please send several e-mails. - Ensure that all documents transmitted (e.g. hospital reports) are anonymized and identified with the participant's identification number. For studies which use e-CRFs: the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information (these new information must be also recorded in the e-CRF). For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the \"report and follow-up form for pregnancy during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. In case of the onset of secondary cancer, the investigator completes the specific form for cancers. Data will be collected on an e-CRF, with data entry performed in each centre by Clinical research assistants (CRA) and/or physicians. Monitoring of the data will be performed by CRA under the superivison of the URC and DRCI. Statistical analysis will be performed by Dr Lucie Biard, Saint Louis hospital, Paris. The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations. For France: Commitment to comply with “Reference Methodology” MR-001 This research is governed by the CNIL (French Data Protection Agency) “Reference Methodology for processing personal data used within the scope of health research” (amended MR-001).

        "METHODOLOGY": "Safety of injections will be evaluated by the rate of treatment-related Serious Adverse Events (SAE) defined as Adverse Events (AE) of grade equal or above 3 using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 classification, at one month after each infusion according to arms (M1, M4). All adverse events will be adjudicated by a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. Treatment-related toxicity will be analyzed according to the international World Health Organization (WHO) (maximum degree of toxic attacks by the body). An injection will be considered as not tolerated for any toxicity criteria above grade ≥ 3 (139). Safety at the time and within the first 24 hours of infusion and during all study follow-up will be evaluated by the Rate of treatment-related SAE defined as AE of grade equal or above 3 CTCAE v5.0 at time and within the first 24 hours of infusion and during all follow-up: M0, M3, M6, M9 and M12. Treatment-related toxicity will be analyzed according to the international World Health Organization (WHO) (maximum degree of toxic attacks by the body). An injection will be considered as not tolerated for any toxicity criteria above grade ≥ 3 (139). Main efficacy endpoint will be assessed by mRSS difference between M0 and M12. Other efficacy disease related secondary endpoints will be: mRSS at M3, M6 and M9. WHO performance status (PS) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaires: Scleroderma-Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ), the Short Form (36) health survey (SF-36v2) and EQ-5D-5L at M0, M3, M6, and M12; Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Diffusing capacity of Lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), at M0, M3, M6, and M12 Response to treatment will be defined as any of the following: decreased mRss > 25%, increased FVC > 10% and/or increased DLCO >10%, without need for further immunosuppression except low dose steroids (below 10mg daily) (140) at M3, M6 and M12. Progression-free survival at 12 months will be defined as the percentage of enrolled patients still alive without evidence of progression 12 months after MSC(AT) injection, with progression defined as any of the following compared to baseline evaluation: decreased FVC > 10% or DLCO > 15%; decrease in LVEF% > 15%; decrease in weight > 15%; decrease in creatinine clearance > 30%; increased mRss > 25% ; and/or increase in SHAQ> 0.5 (140). GRCS at M3, M6 and M12 calculated as previously described (141,142). CRISS for early SSc patients at M3, M6 and M12 calculated as previously described (143,144) Overall survival at 12 months will be defined as the percentage of enrolled patients still alive 12 months after MSC(AT) injection. Myeloid and lymphocyte sub-populations will be analyzed in all included patients at M0, M1, M3, M4, M6, as measured by 2 mass cytometry panels (Cytof) to assess their proportion and activation status Alloimmunization against MSC will be evaluated in all included patients through the detection of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies and identification when positive at M0, M3 and M6 Extra-Cost per QALY (quality-adjusted Life Year) gained by unique and repeated IV infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) in severe SSc after 12 months. QALY will be measured by combining survival data and Health related quality of life data collected with the EQ-5D-5L and transformed into Utilities.  QALYs will be related to Medical and productivity costs. Extra-Cost per treatment-related AE of grade above or equal to 3 CTCAE avoided by unique and repeated IV infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) in severe SSc after 12 months. SAE will be related to medical and productivity costs as well. The efficiency of the 2 schemes of allogeneic MSC(AT) injections will be assessed through cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses, as recommended by the French National Authority for Health. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) will be estimated for the two health economic endpoints, expressed in i) cost per QALY gained and ii) Cost per AE ≥ 3 CTCAE avoided between arm 1 and placebo arm AND arm 2 and placebo arm. The primary analysis will be Bayesian. As it is a safety analysis, it will be performed first on the safety set. Continuous monitoring of the primary endpoint by the sponsor (M1 and M4 visits of each participant) will be implemented to allow continuous Bayesian toxicity monitoring with a stopping rule implemented on the primary endpoint in patients receiving cell infusions. Such interim analyses will be performed unblinded by an independent statistician. During the course of the study Primary safety analyses will be performed sequentially. - initiation: the first analysis will be performed after the first 3 patients complete their M1 visits; - then an analysis will be triggered if a TRSAE within one month after an infusion is observed, to ensure blinding for the investigating team. The stopping rule is defined based on the estimated probability that the risk of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (TRSAE) is >15% after a cell infusion. Define “criterion 1” = the probability that the posterior probability of TRSAE is greater than 15%. The posterior probability of TRSAE (πtrsae) will be estimated using a Bayesian approach with a beta density. πtrsae is considered to be a random variable, with a Beta distribution centered on an prior specified expected probability of SAE of 10%. This expected probability will be updated sequentially as the observations are collected into a so-called posterior density. The prior density will be chosen in the family of combined Beta densities, defined by its two parameters a and b (with a mean =  and a variance =). A weakly informative Beta density will be considered (a=0.1; b=0.9). The parameters of the posterior Beta density An and Bn are calculated from those of the prior Beta density and the number of n infusions, as follows: An=a+r and Bn=b+n-r, where r is the number of TRSAE observed among the n infusions. After n infusions, we have the following estimator: . The stopping rule will be fulfilled if criterion 1 > 0.70 (meaning that we have a high probability that there is a greater than 15% risk of TRSAE after cell infusion). Interim analyses results will be presented to the DSMB for their recommendation.  In the case of an early stopping decision, subsequent patients will not be randomized and all patients treated thus far will be followed up and results analyzed as described below (final analysis). Based on the beta-binomial conjugate posterior distribution, Prob(πtrsae > 0.15 |Data) may only increase if TRSAE are observed. Accordingly, after the initial analysis after the first 3 patients complete their M1 visits, interim analyses will thereafter be triggered if a TRSAE within one month after an infusion is observed (M1 and M4 visits), to ensure blinding. The analysis itself will be performed unblinded by an independent statistician and presented to the DSMB, using the cell infusions available data to compute Criterion 1. “Criterion 1” rule translates into the stopping rules reported in the table below. Table 15. Toxicity stopping rules during the trial * non-binding rules; to be presented to the DSMB for their recommendation Of note, we chose a probability of TRSAE of 15% as a stopping rule based on 3 reasons: 1) our expectation of low risk (<5%) of TRSAE in the month post infusion, 2) cumulative rates of TRSAE in clinical trials for SSc of approximately 30% at 2 years, and 3) our desire to minimize risk to patients (in other settings such as cancer, the usual threshold is fixed at 30%). During this phase of the study, we will consider observations after each infusion to be independent for the following reasons. First, at the time of the first infusions, all observations are necessarily independent. Second, especially early in the trial, we will have insufficient observations for a model accounting for correlations, which would require at least 3 parameters. In fact, with more parameters in the model, this would result in a disproportionate impact of our priors (rather than the observations) on the results. Third, in our experience of early phase adaptive designs, parsimonious models are more efficient. Finally, we expect very few safety events and, given the rapid clearance of the cells after infusion, these are unlikely to be correlated. Finally, the end-of-study model will account for within patient correlations. In sum, our approach aims at optimizing safety during the study while obtaining the best estimates at the end of the study. Sensitivity analyses will be performed considering other priors including beta(0.05,0.95) (prior mean equal to 0.05) and beta(0.01,0.99) (prior mean equal to 0.01) At the end of the study A final safety analysis will be performed by fitting a logistic regression model taking into account the repeated measures and thus the intra-patient correlation (i.e. observations no longer considered independent), as follows: (Model 1) logit(P(at least one TRSAE for patient i at infusion j))=a0 + (b0+bi ) infusionij where a0: intercept; bi: random effect ~ N(0,s2); b0: effect/infusion. We will use a Bayesian estimator with Gibbs sampling, incorporating weakly-informative normal prior distributions for the parameters a0, b0 (Normal(0,10000)) and a fairly weakly-informative uniform for s2 (U(0,100)). All estimations will be accompanied by 95% credible intervals. If the credible interval for b0 includes zero, we will conclude that an infusion of 2 million MSC(AT)/kg is safe in SSc. Moreover, we will perform a secondary analysis considering the cumulative dose from repeated infusions (to answer the question of whether repeated doses are safe) using the following logistic regression model: (Model 2) logit(P(at least one TRSAE for patient i))=a0 + b0 at_least_one_infusioni + b1 two_infusionsi where a0: intercept; b0: effect of first infusion; b1: effect of second infusion. We will use weakly-informative normal prior distributions for the parameters a0, b0, and b1 (Normal(0,10000)). If the credible interval for b1 includes zero, we will conclude that there is no additional risk for the second dose. All analyses will be performed on the Intent-to-treat set except for safety endpoints, which will be analysed on the safety set. Safety Rate of SAE of grade equal or above 3 CTCAE v5.0 at time and within the first 24 hours of infusion and during all follow-up at: M0, M3, M6 and M12. Rates of SAE will be described by treatment arm. If credible intervals for b0 or for b1 in the primary analysis doesn’t include 0, final safety analysis will be repeated according to the primary analysis methodology for the rate of SAE at M0, M3, M6 and M12. Efficacy Main efficacy endpoint: modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) difference between M0 and M12. Concerning the difference R between the mRss at M12 and M0. Efficacy will be assessed using the following linear model: Ri = a0 + b0 at_least_one_infusioni + b1 two_infusionsi + ei, where Ri : difference R between the mRss at M12 and the mRss at M0 for patient i; a0 : intercept; b0: effect of first infusion; b1: effect of second infusion; ei : ~ N(0,s2). We will use weakly-informative normal prior distributions for the parameters a0, b0, and b1 (Normal(0,10000)) and an inverse gamma distribution (1,1) for s2. All estimations will be accompanied by 95% credible intervals. The credible intervals for b0 and b1 will allow us to conclude whether single and/or second infusions are efficacious in SSc. Other secondary endpoints : mRSS at M3, M6 and M9. Evolution of mRSS will be assessed using a linear random effect model to take into account the repeated measurements. Interaction between time and the number of infusions will be assessed and tested. WHO performance status (PS) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) questionnaires: Scleroderma-Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ), the Short Form (36) health survey (SF-36v2) and EQ-5D-5L at M0, M3, M6, and M12. Evolution of the different scales will be assessed using a linear random effect model to take into account the repeated measurements.

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: A prospective multicenter trial comparing allogeneic matched related haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen, with standard of care in adolescents and adults with severe sickle cell disease\nAcronym: DREPA-RIC\nCoordinating Investigator: Dr Nathalie DHEDIN\nHematology. Saint Louis Hospital, AP-HP, Paris.\nScientific Director: Adult scientific Director: \nDr Jean Benoit ARLET\nInternal Medicine\nGeorges Pompidou Hospital, AP-HP, Paris\n\nPediatric scientific Director: \nDr Corinne PONDARRE\nPediatric hematology\nCHI Créteil\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has dramatically improved over the last decades in the US and Europe, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many children and most adults develop a chronic debilitating condition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative approach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children transplanted from a matched related donor (MRD) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen(1),(2). To date, few studies have addressed the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to the toxicity expected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage. The development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid GVHD appears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with severe SCD. Four groups have previously reported encouraging results in a total of 81 patients transplanted from matched related mobilized peripheral blood cells after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab and low dose of total body irradiation (TBI)) followed by post-transplant sirolimus. These studies demonstrate a high SCD free survival rate (no death related to transplant, 6 graft failures) and no GVHD. Ninety two percent of these patients were cured with normalized hemoglobin levels, resolution of hemolysis and stable hemoglobin A levels identical to the proportion observed in the donor(3–6). However, outcome comparison of patients transplanted with patients not transplanted are lacking. We design a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15 years with severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative transplant (when a matched related donor (MRD) is identified) versus no HSCT (for patients lacking MRD).\nMain objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is to assess the benefit of HSCT on the 2-year event free survival calculated from inclusion, compared to standard care. The primary endpoint is the 2-year event free survival. An event is defined as:\ndeath from any cause \nor an acute grade II-IV GVHD according to the Magic consortium 2016 (Appendix 20.3) or a moderate or severe chronic GVHD according to the NIH classification,\n or 3 hospitalizations for VOC defined according to usual criteria \nor one ACS defined by usual clinical criteria and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest film and/or thoracic computed-tomography (CT) scan\nor a stroke defined as a clinical event confirmed by an MRI \nor a cerebral or cervical stenosis > 25% in a new territory, evaluated by MRI and MRA\nor increased of at least +10% of tricuspid regurgitation velocity, (confirmed by 2 echocardiographies performed with a delay of at least 3 months) compared with pre-inclusion value for patients with TRV ≥ 2.7 at inclusion \nor apparition of a silent infarct or a cerebral/cervical stenosis >25% in a new territory, or increase >25% of previous stenosis evaluated MRI and MRA \nWe hypothesize that the 2-year event free survival will be of 80% after HSCT versus 40% in the no-transplant group.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: The secondary objectives: \nCompare in the both groups at 2 years:\nOverall survival\nTotal days requiring hospitalization after the first 5 months post-inclusion. \nAcute complications of SCD: VOC, ACS, priapism \nStroke, silent infarct, cerebral or cervical stenosis on MRA/MRI\nHemolytic index, hematologic and biochemical parameters\nOrgan function (kidney, eyes, heart, lung, liver, bone)\nGrade III-IV Infectious complications \nNeed for transfusion from 6 months post-inclusion \nAlloimmunization rate\nIron overload \nChronic used of oral opioids\nNutritional involvement\nGonadic function and fertility\nQuality of life, anxiety and depression\nCost \nStudy of RBC and WBC adherence \nTo evaluate in the transplant group: chimerism, engraftment, GVHD, patients free of sirolimus at 1 and 2 year post-transplant\nThe secondary end points:\nDeath \nNumber of days requiring hospitalization with exclusion of the 5 first months post-inclusion \nClinical adverse events: number of VOC and ACS requiring hospitalization, number of hospitalization in intensive care unit \nNumber of priapism \nNumber of stroke \nChanges in biological parameters: LDH, aminotransferase, gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, PR, APTT, hemoglobin level, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, percentage of hemoglobin variants, reticulocyte, white blood cells and platelets counts, estimated glomerular function rate\nMicroalbuminuria/creatininuria ratio \nFerritin and transferrin saturation level \nGonadic function: Spermogram in men, LH, FSH, oestrogen in women, testosterone in men at M24; Number of amenorrhea in women.

Event will be defined as followed:\ndeath from any cause \nor an acute grade II-IV GVHD according to the Magic consortium 2016 (Appendix 20.3) or a moderate or severe chronic GVHD according to the NIH classification,\n or 3 hospitalizations for VOC defined according to usual criteria \nor one ACS defined by usual clinical criteria and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest film and/or thoracic computed-tomography (CT) scan\nor a stroke defined as a clinical event confirmed by an MRI \nor a cerebral or cervical stenosis > 25% in a new territory, evaluated by MRI and MRA\nor increased of at least +10% of tricuspid regurgitation velocity, (confirmed by 2 echocardiographies performed with a delay of at least 3 months) compared with pre-inclusion value for patients with TRV ≥ 2.7 at inclusion \nor apparition of a silent infarct or a cerebral/cervical stenosis >25% in a new territory, or increase >25% of previous stenosis evaluated MRI and MRA\nEvent free survival at 2 years calculated from inclusion will also be described in the HSCT group. Overall survival will be defined as the time between date of inclusion and death due to any cause or to date of last follow-up. A propensity score matching analysis will be also performed as a sensitivity analysis to handle potential residual imbalances between arms in confounders.\nA sequential analysis of tolerance data will be performed, using Bayesian methods.\nWe hypothesize that the 2-year event free survival will be of 80% after HSCT versus 40% in the no-transplant group.\nSources of monetary support: French Ministry of Health, PHRC N-2017\nTrial will have a Data Monitoring Committee: Yes",
        "PROCEDURE": "The transplant modalities will be the same as reported by the NIH group: The conditioning regimen will consist on Alemtuzumab (1.03 mg/kg) associated with total-body irradiation of 300 rad with radiation shielding to male gonads. The stem cell source will be PBSC from HLA-identical sibling donor with a goal of 10 × 106 or more of CD34 cells per kilogram of the recipient’s weigh. Sirolimus will be administered for GVHD prophylaxis during the first 12 months post-transplant. In the NIH protocol the sirolimus is continued until donor chimerism reaches 50% in Thymphocytes. However, there are no data showing the impact of T lymphocyte chimerism on myeloid chimerism and on stable engraftment in HSCT for non-malignancies. In the setting of HLA-identical sibling myeloablative transplant for SCD, it has been shown that myeloid chimerism (CD14 for monocytesand CD15 for neutrophils) could predict red cell chimerism and cure of the disease independently of the T cell chimerism (Confidential data, A Magnani, M Cavazzana, Necker, Paris France). Considering these important data, we chose to discontinue the sirolimus at 12 months of transplant whatever the level of T chimerism. This is a phase 3 study. The design is a comparative controlled quasi-experimental (genetic randomization) cohort study with 2 groups of patients: “Exposed” patients are patients with an HLA identical sibling identified who will receive HSCT. “Unexposed” are patients lacking an HLA identical sibling who will receive standard of care. We anticipate 30% of matched-related donors among siblings, so a 1:2 ratio between exposed and unexposed group. Thirty valued centers in France will participate to the study and will recruit patients. Out-patients will be recruited on the site taking them in charge for their SCD and addressed to a center transplant if HSCT will be planned. The participants in this research will be identified as follows: Site number (3 digits) - Sequential enrolment number for the site (4 digits) - surname initial - first name initial This reference number is unique and will be used for the entire duration of the study. Methods for informing and obtaining consent from the research participants Enrolment period: 3 years Duration of participation by each patient: 2 years Total study duration: 5 years After inclusion in the study, HLA typing will be performed to identify potential HLA MRD, and the following data have to be collected. Morphological explorations performed in the last 6 months can be considered for baseline visit. Other explorations should be performed in the 2 months after inclusion Past medical history of SCD complications (VOC, ACS, stroke, silent infarct, pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy, osteonecrosis, hepatopathy related to SCD, priapism, oral opioid consumption. Number of hospitalizations during the last 2 years, hospitalization in ICU, Quality of life questionnaire (MOS SF36), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (addenda 20-3) Indication for trial participation Treatment on going Medical clinical examination (ECOG, blood pressure, weight, height, general examination) Biological parameters: LDH, aminotransferase, gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, PR, APTT, hemoglobin level, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, reticulocyte count, percentage of hemoglobin variants, white blood cells and platelets counts, estimated glomerular function rate, microalbuminuria/creatininuria ratio. Erythrocyte group. RBC alloantibodies. Ferritin and transferrin saturation level Spermogram at time of sperm storage in men if patients not already treated by hydroxyurea. For other patients treated by hydroxyurea, we will collect results of spermogram performed before onset of hydroxyurea at time of the sperm storage. Dosage of LH and FSH, in both men and women, testosterone in men, oestrogen AMH and inhibin in women. Amenorrhea in women. Number of parity. Examination of the retina Heart (pulmonary hypertension, auricular or ventricular dilatation, left ventricular mass and function) by a transthoracic echocardiography. Explored data will be tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity, left atrial and ventricular dimension indexed to body surface, ventricular mass index and left ventricular ejection fraction. Lung function (pulmonary function tests, 6 min walk test) Pelvis radiography Central nervous system function: magnetic resonance imaging of the vessel and the parenchym Liver and heart magnetic resonance imaging for iron overload evaluation in patients with ferritin > 1000 microg/L at the inclusion In the transplant arm: Blood sample for chimerism analysis, serology (B et C hepatitis, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV, HTLV-1 et 2, Toxoplasmosis (IgG et M), TPHA et VDRL, PCR for B, C hepatitis, HIV, and G6-PD dosage Blood samples (4 tubes: 2 with EDTA “7mL”, 1 with protease inhibitor “5mL” and 1 tube with heparin “7mL”) for plasma and serum bank, cell bank and study of RBC and WBC adherence (fresh experiments), and WBC subpopulation taken as part of the research will be included in a biological collection Oral consumption of opioids questionnaire Patients with a HLA MRD will be transplanted and compared with other patients. Fertility preservation and contraception in transplanted patients: In men: considering the potential impact on fertility of the conditioning regimen including 3 Gy TBI (87) and of treatment by sirolimus, a sperm storage will be performed before transplant. In most patients receiving hydroxyurea, sperm storage has been performed before hydroxyurea initiation. It’s important to stress the point that radiation shielding will be applied to male gonads to decrease the risk of post-transplant hypofertility. In pre-clinic models, no teratogenicity was reported with sirolimus (data from the CRAT: Centre de Référence sur les Agents Tératogènes). In women: In theory, 3 GY ovarian radiation doesn’t induce immediate post-treatment ovarian failure 90, but, there are few data concerning pregnancy after this conditioning 3-4. Considering that egg or ovarian pre-transplant conservation can be associated in SCD patients with complications such as thrombosis, VOC and ACS, we don’t propose systematically pre-transplant technic of fertility preservation. Decision for performing or not fertility preservation before transplant will take into account the results of pre-transplant ovarian function evaluation, age of patient, pregnancy wish and risk of the procedure. If necessary investigators can contact Pr C. Poirot (fertility preservation specialist: catherine.poirot@aphp.fr) for discussing indication of pre-transplant fertility preservation. For the patients who will not have fertility preservation before transplant, ovarian function will be monitor after transplant and post-transplant fertility preservation by egg storage could be proposed after sirolimus cessation. Contraception will be performed from the onset of conditioning regimen, continued during all the duration of treatment by sirolimus and could be stopped 12 weeks after the cessation of sirolimus. Out-patients will be screening by the physicians in charge of them for the treatment of SCD. After screening, the patient will be addressed to an investigator in charge of transplant to receive informations about HSCT. Then, patients agreeing with the design of the study will be included by investigators in charge of them or physicians in charge of transplant. The sites of recruitment are pediatric and adult units. Patients will HLA matched sibling donor will be referred to transplant unit for HSCT. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant's best interests. If a participant exits the study prematurely, all data about that participant may be used until consent is withdrawn. If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant exited or was withdrawn from the study: Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent If a participant exits the study prematurely due to a serious adverse event, a serious adverse event notification form will be sent by mail to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. The data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) can specify and/or validate the monitoring methods. After the start of the alemtuzumab treatment, if the patient: - suffers an adverse event of particular interest (see section 12.1.2.2.1), - has or develops a contraindication to alemtuzumab after first administration - experienced a treatment related disease considered as severe or evolving, the patient will be withdrawn from the treatment. Ending a subject's participation does not affect the normal management of the subject's illness in any way. Patient who withdraws from the alemtuzumab treatment will follow the entire trial as planned according to the protocol agenda. If a subject discontinues the study before the availability of the HLA tests, i.e. before the choice of treatment group, he will be replaced. Otherwise, all subjects will be included in the analysis. The investigator should initially complete a SAE reporting form (contained in the case report form). This report must be signed by the investigator. The investigator must complete every section of the SAE form so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate assessment. The initial report sent to the sponsor must be rapidly followed up by one or more additional written reports describing the course of the event and any complementary information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be anonymized. In addition, the investigator must state the study acronym and the number and initials of the study participant on each paper. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has terminated his participation in the trial. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's safety Department by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor’s safety department. It is possible to send the SAE to the Safety department by fax to the sponsor’s safety department, fax No. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE by e-mail and in order to avoid duplicates. For trials which use e-CRF the investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by mail; In case of failure to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE report form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the investigator must complete the SAE report form in the e-CRF. The investigator must comply with all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the “Follow-up form for reporting a pregnancy occurring in a clinical trial”. The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman until delivery or until premature interruption, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure as for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy report form, the SAE follow-up forms and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor using the same modalities as described in this section. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "Data will be entered electronically via a web browser.",
        "STATISTICAL": "The following analysis sets will be considered: Intent-to-treat: Includes all randomized subjects analysed according to their planned group. This will refer to the primary analyses Per protocol set: Includes all subjects from the intent-to-treat set without any major violations which could affect the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint and analysed according to their actually group. This will be used as secondary, exploratory or sensitivity analyses Safety set: Includes all subjects who take any amount of study drug. Quantitative data will be described as median and interquartile range, and qualitative data as count and percentage. Statistical analyses will be perform on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, meaning that all patients will be analyzed according to their planned group (“exposed” = HSCT or “non exposed” = standard of care), regardless of the fact that they were finally transplanted or not. No efficacy interim analysis will be performed, and the final analysis will take place two years after the last patient’s inclusion. Primary endpoint, 2-years event-free survival after time of inclusion, will be non-parametrically assessed using Kaplan Meier estimate, and will be compared between two arms using log-rank test. Effect of transplantation will be assessed by hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval by fitting a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Complementary to the primary analysis: a sensitivity analysis, based on the per protocol population a sensitivity analysis, based on propensity score matching analysis will be performed. This analysis seeks to ensure the robustness of the primary analysis by handling potential residual imbalances between arms in confounders. Propensity score will be constructed based on known or observed prognostic factors and known or observed factors associated with treatment arm. Methods for analysing secondary endpoints: All time to event secondary endpoints will be analysed in the same way as the primary outcome Binary endpoints will be compared between two arms using Fisher’s exact test Continuous endpoints will be compared between two arms using Wilcoxon rank sum test Endpoints with multiple measurement across follow-up will be analysed using mixed effect regression model to take into account the within-patients correlation Statistical analysis for safety data: Safety analyses will involve examination of the incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events reported, changes in vital signs and laboratory test results from baseline (Day 0 pre-dose) to specified time points throughout the study, and concomitant medications use. The population of analysis will be all patients included in the trial according to the treatment actually received, regardless of the duration. Adverse Events Adverse events reported during the study will be coded using a MedDRA dictionary. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by treatment group and the following: System organ class and preferred term System organ class, preferred term and severity These summaries will be presented for the following subsets: Serious adverse events All adverse events Drug-related adverse events Adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study drug Outcome of adverse events Action taken For tables reporting adverse events by severity, if a subject has multiple occurrences of an adverse event with the same organ class and preferred term, the most severe event will be presented. A summary and by-subject listing will be provided for all subjects who experienced any adverse events, serious adverse events, or adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study drug. A sequential analysis of tolerance data will be performed, using Bayesian methods, to allow detecting any increased rate of serious adverse events differing across arms. Using a Bayesian beta-binomial model, the rate of SAEs will be sequentially computed with its 95% credible interval in both arms. The maximum rate acceptable for SAEs has been set at 30%. The probability that the rate of SAEs is above 30% will be computed. Adverse events of special interest (AESI) defined above (section 12.1.2.2.1) and a tolerable risk difference of δ =20% between the two arms on the AESIs that involve both arms will be considered. Using a Bayesian beta-binomial model, the event rate of each AESIs in the two arms will be assessed for each DSMB and upon request of the DSI (along with their 95% credible interval). When SAEs and AESs involved both arms, the probability that the risk difference exceed δ, will be assessed for each DSMB and upon request of the DSI. Method for taking into account missing, unused or invalid data In case of missing data, complete case analyses will be performed. Confirmatory analyses will be performed by using multiple imputation by chained equation to impute outcome as well as missing characteristics. At least 20 imputed datasets will be considered."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Multicenter randomized double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of belimumab in the treatment of non-infectious active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis compared to placebo\nAcronym: TRIBECA: Treatment after RItuximab with BElimumab in Cryoglobulinemia Associated vasculitis\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr David SAADOUN \nDepartment of Internal medicine and clinical Immunology\nCentre national de référence des Maladies Autoimmunes et Systémiques rares\nHospital Pitié Salpétrière\nTel.0142178009\nEmail : david.saadoun@aphp.fr\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and requires therapeutic intervention. The management of noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on corticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade, several groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved effective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete clinical response in 65-70% of patients. However, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40% patients within few days to nineteen months after the last rituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown that serum BLys concentration was correlated with serum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In agreement with data in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, we also observed decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining which was correlated with disease severity. Following rituximab serum BLys concentration significantly increased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B cell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A recent study has shown that rituximab does not reset defective early B cell tolerance checkpoints. An obvious solution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from precipitating a flare of disease following rituximab therapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of disease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF blockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and BAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone and follicular compartments more effectively than either treatment alone. A combination of B cell depletion and BAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone with respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts and plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity, in three different mouse models of lupus.

Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources. This design is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements. We thus used the approach for phase II randomized trials proposed by Simon R, Wittes RE, and Ellenberg SS that aims at controlling the probability of detecting a given difference in response rates. We hypothesize that up to 70% of the patients receiving placebo of belimumab and 85% of those treated by belimumab will achieve a complete remission of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis at week 25 (W25) and with steroid therapy stopped (0 mg/day) at W12.\nSources of funding for the trial: GSK who will also provide belimumab Benlysta® and placebo of belimumab.\nTrial will have a Data Monitoring Committee: Yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and require therapeutic intervention 1. The management of noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on corticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade, several groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved effective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete clinical response in 65-70% of patients 2. However, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40% patients within few days to nineteen months after the last rituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown that serum BLys concentration was correlated with serum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non Hodgkin’s lymphoma 3. In agreement with data in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome we also observed decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining which was correlated with disease severity 3. Following rituximab serum BLys concentration significantly increased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B cell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A recent study has shown that rituximab does not reset defective early B cell tolerance checkpoints 4. An obvious solution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from precipitating a flare of disease following rituximab therapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of disease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF blockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and BAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone and follicular compartments more effectively than either treatment alone 5. A combination of B cell depletion and BAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone with respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts and plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity, in three different mice models of lupus. Cryoglobulinemia is associated with increased risk of developing lymphoid neoplasm mainly marginal zone lymphoma. In addition, promising results have been observed in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis treated by rituximab plus belimumab (unpublished observations) and with good safety profile. This provides a strong rationale for targeting B cell depletion and BAFF blockade in cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. TRIBECA STUDY (Treatment after RItuximab with BElimumab in Cryoglobulinemia Associated vasculitis) is the first double blind randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of belimumab to that placebo after rituximab in the treatment of non-infectious active cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Group I: Belimumab Benlysta® administered subcutaneously 200mg weekly from week 1 to week 24. Group II: Placebo of Belimumab administered subcutaneously weekly from week 1 to week 24. The experimental design is a multicentric randomized controlled clinical trial stratified on previous treatment history (naive patients versus relapsing patients) and the severity of  cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (i.e. extensive skins necrosis, glomerulonephritis, multiple mononeuropathy, myocarditis, digestive or central nervous system specific involvement) in a 1:1 ratio between groups with evaluation of the primary assessment criteria at week 25. The primary assessment criteria and the final measures of corticosteroid sparing will be reviewed by an endpoint adjudication committee blinded of the randomization. This committee will have the role of validating under blind conditions the following assignments: complete remission, treatment failure and relapse of the disease. The RCT will use an adaptive Bayesian design for phase II randomized national multicentre clinical trial that aims at comparing a new treatment to a reference based on a binary endpoint (i.e. complete clinical response at week 25), which offers greater flexibility and simplicity of inference to the monitoring for patient safety and evidence of efficacy of small randomized trials. Week 0: Day of Inclusion and Randomization in a 1:1 ratio Group I: Belimumab administered subcutaneously 200mg weekly from week 1 to week 24. Group II: placebo of Belimumab administered subcutaneously weekly from week 1 to week 24. Both groups will have the same corticosteroid tapering scheme, with an initial dose of 30 mg/day. The following schedule of reduction of prednisone will apply to both groups as long as the disease is inactive: 30 mg/day week (W)0-W2, 20 mg/day W2-W4 15 mg/day W4-W6, 10 mg/day W6-W8, 5 mg/day W8-W10, Between W10-W12 the strategy for stopping glucocorticoids is left to the investigator's discretion, Stopping glucocorticoid therapy at W12 At each step, the prednisone dose will be reduced only in the absence of signs of vasculitis activity. In case of minimal to moderate relapse, the dose of prednisone will be re-increased to the previous level, and the new dose should be maintained for 4 weeks before resuming the regimen of corticosteroid decay. First administration of belimumab or placebo for patients who satisfy all entry criteria including informed consent will be done within 7 days (+/-2 days) at visit W1 after inclusion/randomisation. Week 5: evaluation of clinical response Week 25: Evaluation of primary assessment criteria Week 13, 25 and 48: Evaluation of secondary assessment criteria Figure 1. Scheme of the study *Due to pharmaceutic deliverance of belimumab and its placebo, the fisrt injection will occur within 7 days +/-2 days after randomization Multicentre national study including 20 centres. The investigating doctor may request unblinding for any reason he considers essential, by contacting: In emergency cases at the poison control centre at Fernand Widal Hospital, Telephone: +33 (0)1 40 05 48 48. Apart from an emergency situation at the DRCI (Clinical Research and Innovation Department) to the DRCI project advisor whose contact information are listed on the protocol cover page :Project Manager Elodie SOLER, Tel. 01 44 84 17 35 The French national reference center for rare systemic and autoimmune diseases located in the Pitie Salpetriere hospital, Paris is a leading center in the field of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis with a cohort of more than 500 patients. With the French cryoglobulinemia vasculitis network, we recently conducted a study on management of noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and recruited 242 patients. We are working in close collaboration with French neurologist, nephrologist, dermatologist and rheumatologist including those from Pitie Salpetriere hospital, in Paris. Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a subject from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the subject's best interests. Participants lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up In case of patient withdrawal, patient will not be replaced. The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. Special rules for trials involving the administration of a radioactive product (e.g. PET scan): if a subject develops secondary cancer/cancer or develops a hereditary deficiency following exposure to ionising radiation, the investigator shall complete the special form for reporting cancer. The investigator will permit the sponsor’s representatives to monitor the study at the frequency defined in the contract, depending on enrolment at each center. Case Report Forms (CRFs) and related source documents will be reviewed in detail during monitoring visit (completeness, adherence to the guidelines, accuracy compared to source documents). The sponsor’s representative will also review regulatory documents, drug storage and accountability. The investigator must maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all study-related documentation that is suitable for inspection by sponsor’s monitors or representatives of other regulatory agencies. The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations. This research is governed by the CNIL (French Data Protection Agency) “Reference Methodology for processing personal data used within the scope of health research” (amended MR-001). AP-HP, as sponsor of the research, has signed a declaration of compliance with this “Reference Methodology”",

        "METHODOLOGY": "Complete clinical response rate of vasculitis symptoms at W25 with corticosteroid withdrawal (prednisone at 0 mg/day) at week (W) 12. The complete clinical response is defined by the remission of all affected organs involved at baseline and the absence of clinical relapse. The skin and articular remissions are evaluated clinically (disappearance of purpura and/or ulcers, disappearance of arthritis). Renal remission is evaluated biologically (proteinuria <0.5g/24h or proteinuria/creatininuria <50 mg/mmol) . Neurological remission is evaluated clinically (any improvement of pains and paresthesia by visual analogue scales, any stabilization or improvement of muscular testing in case of motor impairment at baseline) and electrophysiologically (stabilization or improvement of electromyogram abnormalities at W25 compared to baseline). Digestive remission is evaluated clinically (improvement of abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms), by endoscopy (improvement of potential gastrointestinal lesions seen at baseline) and/or by Xray (improvement of any abnormalities found on baseline imaging). Complete remission of all baseline abnormalities is required to define digestive remission. Cardiac remission is evaluated clinically (improvement of chest pains and other cardiac events), electrically (disappearance of abnormalities indicating acute myocardial suffering on EKG) and biologically (normalization of muscular enzymes). Complete remission of all baseline abnormalities is required to define cardiac remission. Central nervous system remission is evaluated clinically (stabilization or improvement of central nervous system manifestation) and by MRI (stabilization or disappearance of vasculitis sign) Pulmonary remission is evaluated clinically (improvement of dyspnea and disappearance of hemoptysis) and by chest scan (improvement of vasculitis sign) Patients with no clinical response at W5 will be defined as early treatment failure (failure for the principal judgment criteria); unblinded, the optimal treatment will be performed by the physician in charge of the patient. Patients with clinical relapse (defined as de novo appearance or recurrence of a manifestation due to the cryoglobulinemia vasculitis) between W5 and W25 will be considered in failure according to the primary endpoint. For severe relapses, unblinded the optimal treatment will be performed by the physician in charge of the patient and therapeutic management will be at the discretion of the investigator according to standard of care. Patients with moderate or mild relapse will be treated by an increase of the corticosteroids without breaking the double-blind. A severe flare-up is defined by the appearance or reappearance of one of the following signs: Extensive skin necrosis with loss of substance Specific cardiac involvement of vasculitis (documented by EKG, troponin and MRI) Specific digestive impairment of vasculitis (documented by imaging and/or endoscopy) Affection of the central nervous system specific to vasculitis (documented by cerebral MRI) Multiple mononeuropathy clinically defined by asymmetrical motor impairment of 2 or more nerve trunks. (documented by electromyogram) Severe renal impairment defined as a doubling of creatinine levels from the usual value or a glomerular filtration rate according to MDRD of less than 30 ml/min/1.73m2 (in the absence of prior history of creatinine levels) and after excluding other causes of renal impairment. Other flare up [appearance or reappearance of purpura, arthritis, sensory neuropathy documented by electromyogram and/or glomerulonephritis (proteinuria>1g/24h after excluding other causes of proteinuria)] will be defined as moderate or mild at the discretion of the investigator. - Safety and tolerability of treatments as assessed by frequency and severity of adverse clinical events from baseline to W25 and at W48 - Complete, partial and non clinical response rate at W13, W25 and at W48. - Complete renal response rate at W13, W25 and W48 defined by : proteinuria <0.5g/24h or proteinuria/creatininuria <50 mg/mmol, disappearance of hematuria and glomerular filtration rate by MDRD >  60 ml/min/1.73 m². - Rate of cryoglobulinemia clearance, negativation of rheumatoid factor activity and of normalization of C4 complement level at W13, W25 and at W48, - Rate of early failures (non clinical response at W5), - Clinical relapse rate defined by de novo appearance or recurrence of a manifestation attributable to cryoglobulinemia vasculitis during 48 weeks of follow-up, - Rate and time to relapse from baseline to W48 - Cumulative dose of prednisone at W25 and at W48, - Evolution of gammaglobulin and of CD19+ B levels from baseline to W48 - Quality of life score SF-36 at baseline, W25 and W48, - Rate of infections (severe or not) and other complications during the 48 weeks of follow-up - BVAS activity score at baseline, W13, W25 and W48.",

        "STATISTICAL": "This is a Bayesian Phase II randomized clinical trial that aims at evaluating the treatment strategy of non infectious cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, based on difference in the response rate as measured at week 25 after randomization. Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources (Sharma 2011). Moreover, we chose to design the trial as a Bayesian clinical trial, for three main reasons. First, this allows incorporating information outside the trial that results in a decrease in required sample size due to such “fictive” observations. Secondly, Bayes designs are particularly well-suited for adaptive designs, given inference is based on accumulated data along the trial, allowing interim and sequential analyses without any inflation of type I error or biased estimation (Wang 2016). Third, this design is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements. We will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of response in the arm A=k (k=1,2). Using a beta Be(,) prior for k, the posterior probability of k is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. In our setting, the inefficacy of the drug will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment response rate”. It has been set at 0.70 in this trial. Thus, we will compute for each arm (1) Of note, if the true response rate in the Belimumab arm is 0.85,  should be below 0.05. However, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of the experimental treatment over the control arm (Whitehead 2014). Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the control by some targeted minimal level. This will be done by computing the value of the posterior probability of the difference in response rates between the experimental arm and the control (Xie 2012): Being the probability in the placebo arm and . In this study if=0.7 and =0.85 this probability should be above 0.90. Calculations will be based using ak=0.5 an bk=0.5 for both arms. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using ak=0.7 an bk=0.3 for the placebo arm and using ak=0.85 an bk=0.25 for the Belimumab arm."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Phase II multicenter study of talimogene laherparepvec in classic or endemic Kaposi sarcoma\nAcronym: KAPVEC\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr Céleste LEBBE\nOncodermatologie - Hopital Saint Louis\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted by immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic posttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration, in association with local or systemic therapies as chemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and endemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression cannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified, mostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS. Most aggressive forms with visceral involvement are treated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at best 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well tolerated in elderly patients. \nTalimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or unresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or cutaneous lesions. It is designed to induce tumor regression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects, and of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic antitumor immunity.\nIn Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have proven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that immunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors. Two cases of metastatic MCC succesfully treated with talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an effective therapeutic option. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the cutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: The main objective is to assess whether talimogene laherparepvec is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<10%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>40%) in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma.\nThe primary endpoint is the best overall response rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response of the injected lesions following PGA criteria (PGA 0 to 4) recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific therapy for Kaposi sarcoma if it occurs before 6 months.\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives:\n- Safety profile of talimogene laherparepvec in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma\n- Other parameters of efficacy (best response, response rate, duration of response)\n- Efficacy on injected and uninjected lesions\n- Quality of life \n\nExploratory objectives\n- To characterize the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec related to immunologic and viral assessment on tumor biopsies and blood samples\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n- Adverse events (following the CTCAE v5.0)\n- BORR according to the ACTG criteria, response rate at month 3 and 6, response rate on lymphedema, time to response, duration of response\n- Response on injected and uninjected target lesions\n- Deaths from any cause \n- KS-adapted DLQI score\n\nExploratory endpoints:\n- Characterize the immune tumor infiltrate (immune cells quantification), viral infiltrate and tumor necrosis before and after treatment\n- HHV8 viral load in blood and tumor cells; HHV8 sequencing\nDesign of the trial: Phase II multicentre single arm open label trial\nPopulation of trial subjects: Adult patients\nInclusion criteria: - Classic or endemic histologically confirmed Kaposi sarcoma (KS) that is progressive, but does not require a systemic therapy ;\n- Injectable and measurable disease, defined as: \nAt least 2 cutaneous lesion ≥10mm in its largest diameter, in a not previously irradiated field;\nAt least 2 other cutaneous lesion ≥10mm in their largest diameter available for repeated cutaneous biopsies, in a not previously irradiated field. \nNB: Each cutaneous lesion can be replaced by a cluster of small lesions with edge to edge distance <2 mm, if the biggest diameter of each cluster meet the previous criteria.\n- Be willing to provide tissue from cutaneous biopsy;\n- At least 4 weeks washout for all KS specific therapies including topical treatment, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy including interferon;\n- Provide written, informed consent prior to the performance of any study specific procedures;\n- Be more than 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n- Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.\n- Demonstrate adequate organ function:\nHaematological : Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500/mm3; Platelets ≥100 000/mm3; haemoglobin≥ 8 g/dL;\nRenal:  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), OR calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40mL/min (using MDRD formula) for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 x ULN.\nHepatic: AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5xULN, serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels >1.5xULN. \nPT≤1.5; PTT (TCA) ≤1.5\n- Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication\n- Have a health insurance.\nExclusion criteria: - Known history of organ transplantation, including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, or HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies detected at selection);\n- Symptomatic visceral involvement of KS including brain metastases;\n- Active autoimmune disease that requires systemic treatment or has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Oncolytic viruses represent a novel drug class in which native or modified viruses are used for the treatment of cancer. Oncolytic viruses mediate tumor regression through a virus-induced lytic effect in tumor cells, and through the activation of the innate immune system by the virus coupled with antigen release by dying tumor cells. It creates a favorable microenvironment for the adaptive systemic antitumor immunity, thus being able of regressing tumor at distant, uninjected sites. Talimogene laherparepvec is an attenuated herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) derived by functional deletion of 2 genes, ICP34.5 and ICP47, and insertion of coding sequence for human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Deletion of ICP34.5 allows selective replication of talimogene laherparepvec in tumor tissue; normal cells are able to protect against talimogene laherparepvec infection as they contain intact anti-viral defense mechanisms. Deletion of ICP47 prevents down-regulation of antigen presentation molecules and increases the expression of HSV US11 gene, which enhances viral replication in tumor cells. GM-CSF recruits and activates antigen presenting cells which can process and present tumor-derived antigens to promote an effector T-cell response (1). In virus-induced tumors as Kaposi sarcoma, there is a growing evidence that immunotherapy could be more effective than the usual treatments as chemotherapy. In Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors as PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have proven efficacy in phase II trials (2,3). Two cases of metastatic MCC successfully treated with talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an effective therapeutic option (4). In KS, our team and others reported some cases of patients successfully treated with PD1 blockade (5,6); some clinical studies are currently ongoing. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the cutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic KS appears as a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec.",
        "PROCEDURE": "Talimogene laherparepvec will be given by intralesionnal injection at the dose of 10^6 pfu/ml (up to 4 ml) at week 1, then 10^8 pfu/ml (up to 4 ml) at week 4 and every 2 weeks, only in KS cutaneous lesions, up to 6 months or complete regression of injected lesions, clinically significant progression or unacceptable toxicity. See Section 7 for further information about the administration of the product. Multicenter single arm open-label phase II study. The design of this phase II trial is an optimum Simon’s two-stage design to test the null hypothesis that the best overall response rate (BORR) of CR or PR (PGA 0 to 4), P ≤ 0,100 versus the alternative that P ≥ 0,400. This a two stage design; after testing the drug on 9 patients in the first stage, the trial will be terminated if 1 or fewer respond and will continue if 2 or more patients respond. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 20 patients will be studied. If the total number responding is less than or equal to 4, the drug is rejected. Between the 2 stages, inclusions could be suspended until the observation of the BORR at 6 months of the last included patient of the first stage. Nevertheless, if 2 CR or PR are observed before patient 9, no stopping in the inclusions is required. This is a multicenter French national study including 2 participating centres, members of the Groupe de Cancérologie Cutanée. Patients will be recruited in hospital by dermatologist experts in KS management. Before any examination or intervention may be carried out for the trial, the investigator must obtain the free, informed and written consent of the subject participating in the trial, or of his/her legal representative where applicable. Subjects participating in the clinical studies described in article L.1121-1(1° paragraph) of the Code de la Santé Publique are eligible for prior medical examination appropriate for the trial. The screening, follow-up and end-of-study visits can be performed at a out-patient basis or in hospitalisation upon investigator choice. They will be performed by the investigator or his/her qualified designee. Different situations Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the subject's source file and the case report form (CRF); Premature termination of treatment, but the subject remains enrolled in the study until the end of the subject's participation: the investigator must document the reason; Premature termination of treatment and exit from the study; Planned termination of the study. If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Other medical problem Subject's personal reasons Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Other If a patient consent is withdrawn then this patient will be excluded from the analysis, except if the patient allows investigators to use the already collected data for the primary endpoint. A new patient will be included in order to be able to apply the Simon’s Optimal Design. All patients included will be analyzed (Intention to treat Analysis). Immunologic and viral evaluations will be performed on sequential samples: Peripheral blood will be collected at 3 time points (at baseline, before the first dose and at week 6/cycle 3/EOT) in one heparinate sample of 20 ml and one EDTA tube. Skin biopsy will be collected at 2 time points: before the first dose (uninjected lesion), at week 6/cycle 3 (one uninjected lesions, and one injected lesions). For each Kaposi lesion: Two 3mm punch biopsy samples, or one 6 mm biopsy that will be cut in half, will be performed: one is flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C, the other is fixed in formalin or AFA. During follow up biopsy should be performed on residual disease, if possible of a same Kaposi lesion, if not of another lesion contiguous to the first lesion. Please refer to Table 5 and annexe 18.5 for the distinction between target lesion, biopsy lesion and injected/uninjected lesions. The investigator should initially complete a SAE reporting form (contained in the case report form). This report must be signed by the investigator. The investigator must complete every section of the SAE form so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate assessment. The initial report sent to the sponsor must be rapidly followed up by one or more additional written reports describing the course of the event and any complementary information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be anonymized. In addition, the investigator must state the study acronym and the number and initials of the study participant on each paper. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has terminated his participation in the trial. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's safety Department by mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). The investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by mail; In case of failure to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE report form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the investigator must complete the SAE report form in the e-CRF. The investigator must comply with all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the initial notification and follow-up report forms for pregnancy exposure during trial participation\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy ends, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy report form, the SAE follow-up forms and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor using the same modalities as described above. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.",
        "OBJECTIVES": "The main objective is to assess whether talimogene laherparepvec is clinically inactive (partial+complete response probability π0<10%) or truly active (partial+complete response probability π1>40%) in classic and endemic Kaposi sarcoma.

        "STATISTICAL": "This is a multicenter non-randomized phase II study, based on a 2-stage phase II Simon’s Optimal Design. The main endpoint is the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) defined by the occurrence of complete response or partial response following PGA criteria (PGA 0 to 4) recorded from the start of treatment until 6 months or the beginning of any other specific systemic therapy for KS if it occurs before 6 months The design was developed to test the null hypothesis that the BORR of CR or PR, P ≤ 0,100 versus the alternative that P ≥ 0,400. This a two stage design; after testing the drug on 9 patients in the first stage, the trial will be terminated if 1 or fewer respond and will continue if 2 or more patients respond. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 20 patients will be studied. If the total number responding is less than or equal to 4, the drug is rejected. Between the 2 stages, inclusions could be suspended until the observation of the BORR at 6 months of the last included patient of the first stage. Nevertheless, if 2 CR or PR are observed before patients 9 no stopping in the inclusions is required. Description As a general strategy, continuous efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using summary measures (median and interquartile range). Frequency distributions (counts and percentages) will be used to describe categorical endpoints. Similarly, characteristics of patients will be presented using summary measures (median and interquartile range for quantitative characteristics and counts and percentages for categoriel characteristics). Interim analysis The interim analysis will be based on the first successively included 9 patients, when their response will be recorded (at most 6 months after study inclusion). According to the design exposed above, interim analysis of efficacy will be based on the observation of Best Overall Response (See Sample size 12.2). Based on our hypotheses, it was computed that 9 patients would be accrued in stage 1. If necessary, inclusion will be stopped during 6 months after the 9th inclusion waiting for the primary endpoint. The trial will stop with conclusion of inactivity if 0 or 1 response is observed in this stage; otherwise, 11 additional patients will be recruited to a total sample size of 20 patients, with at least 5 responses to indicate that the drug is effective enough. If the total number responding is less than or equal to 4, the drug is rejected. In case of two observed responses before the end of stage 1, the stage 2 will directly begin without any stop. Terminal analysis It will be based on intent-to-treat principle, that is, all patients will be analysed whatever the treatment has been administered or not unless consent withdrawal. Primary endpoint Terminal analysis will be done once all patients have been included and at the end of their follow-up, and data quality checked. Point estimates with 95% exact confidence intervals (95%CI) will be computed for the BORR. Secondary endpoint: 1/ Safety endpoints All Adverse event will be fully described; safety will be assessed in terms of drug toxicity evaluated by clinic and changes in laboratory parameters, and scored according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_50). 2/ Efficacy endpoints - The Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) of the injected and uninjected target lesions according to the ACTG criteria will be described by count and percentage with their 95% exact Confidence Intervals (95%CI) - the Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) of the uninjected target lesions according to the PGA criteria will be described by count and percentage with their 95% exact Confidence Intervals (95%CI) - the response rate of the injected and uninjected target lesions at month 3 and month 6 according to the PGA and ACTG criteria will be described by count and percentage with their 95% exact Confidence Intervals (95%CI) - the response rate on lymphedema at month 3, month 6 and at best response (as defined by the primary endpoint) will be described by count and percentage with their 95% exact Confidence Intervals (95%CI) - The time to response, defined as the time to first response (following the primary endpoint) recorded from the start of treatment will be estimated by Kaplan. Median and its 95CI will be given. In case of patient death we will consider competing events (death precluding the occurrence of response); in the latter case, cumulative incidence will be considered and Gray’s estimator used. - the duration of response will be estimated between the date of first response and any disease progression or death or end of the follow up. - Deaths from any cause Patients will be censored at the end of follow up. Median and its 95CI will be given using Kaplan Meier estimator. Analyses will be performed on SAS (SAS Inc, cary, NC) and/or R (http://www.R-project.org/) software packages. As described above the targeted alpha risk was 0.05 and it will be 0.035 according to the 2 stage Simon’s design. The targeted power was 0.90 and it will be 0.902. Concerning the primary endpoint no missing data is allowed given the chosen design. In case of loss of follow up the LOCF approach will be applied. Concerning secondary endpoints or patients characteristics, complete case analyses will be performed. Additionally, multiple imputation by chained equation will be considered."

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "An immunomodulatory role of capmatinib was recently suggested. Concomitant MET inhibition promoted adoptive T cell transfer and checkpoint immunotherapies in murine cancer models by increasing effector T cell infiltration in tumors. This therapeutic effect was independent of tumor cell-intrinsic MET dependence. In the absence of MET inhibition, neutrophils recruited to T cell-inflamed microenvironments rapidly acquired immunosuppressive properties, restraining T cell expansion and effector functions. In cancer patients, high serum levels of the MET ligand HGF correlated with increasing neutrophil counts and poor responses to checkpoint blockade therapies (1). Another pre-clinical study reported that the combination of capmatinib + PD-1 antibody was more efficient than capmatinib alone or PD-1 antibody alone in a model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, the combination of MET-inhibitor and PD-1 antibody increased the activated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T-cell (2). A Phase Ib/II study of capmatinib in combination with spartalizumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma is currently recruiting (NCT02795429). No other trial with this combination is ongoing in oesogastric cancer. The purpose of the proposal is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of capmatinib and spartalizumab in pre-treated oesogastric adenocarcinoma. Moreover, efficacy will be assessed according to MET expression or amplification level and PD-L1 expression in order to obtain data to identify potential sub-group(s) of patients that will benefit the most from the combination treatment.",
        "PROCEDURE": "The dosage of capmatinib recommended from previous phase II trials is 400 mg twice daily either in monotherapy or in association with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The dosage of spartalizumab recommended from previous phase Ib trials is either 300 mg Q3W or 400 mg Q4W. The schedule for the combination used in the ongoing NCT02795429 trial (hepatocellular carcinoma) is spartalizumab 300 mg Q3W + capmatinib 400 mg twice per day. For the present study, the same dosage of spartalizumab 300 mg Q3W + capmatinib 400 mg twice per day will be used as in the NCT02795429 trial (resulting in treatment cycles of 3-week duration). The study will be multicenter single-arm adaptive phase II trial. Patients will be receiving the investigational combination regimen until progression, patient’s refusal or unacceptable toxicity, and for a maximum of 12 months (Capmatinib 400 mg BID and 16 spartalizumab cycles of 3 weeks). The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at 6 months after treatment initiation (see next section below for detailed definition). Toxicity will be monitored sequentially during the trial allowing a toxicity stopping rule in case of high probability of unacceptable toxicity risk [Ivanova-Clin. Invest-2015]. Associated translational researches Pharmacokinetics of capmatinib The solubility of capmatinib is poor (BCS class II compound) and pH-dependent. Capmatinib absorption has a 37.5% decrease in Cmax and a 25.2% decrease in AUC inf with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics in patients with partial or total gastrectomy has never been assessed. Pharmacokinetic profiling will be conducted on the first 20 patients included: 10 patients with total gastrectomy and 10 patients with partial gastrectomy or no gastrectomy treated with PPI in order to assess the impact of gastrectomy and drug-drug interaction with PPI. The pharmacokinetics of capmatinib will be investigated during phase II study, at cycle 2 day 1 (steady state). Following PK parameters of capmatinib will be determined using noncompartmental analysis (WinNonlin Pharsight Corporation: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), maximum plasma concentration time (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), clearance (Cl), mean residence time (MRT), and distribution volume (Vd/F). A second pharmacokinetics study for trough and peak plasma levels will be conducted on all patients (90) included in this study. The concentrations of capmatinib will be investigated at cycle 2 day 1 for 70 patients and at cycle 3 day 1 for all patients. Blood sampling schedule Pharmacokinetic profiles Blood sampling for this study will be taken according to the schedule provided in the following table: Trough and peak plasma levels A second pharmacokinetics study will be performed on all patients (90) included in this study at C2D1 and C3D1. * Patients will  be alerted not to take capmatinib in the morning before the sampling. On those days intake will occur at the hospital after the sampling. Blood samples of 5.0 mL will be collected into heparinized tubes before the morning intake of capmatinib and before perfusion of spartalizumab. Immediately after collection, tubes will be inverted several times and kept at approximately 4 °C until centrifugation. The tubes will be centrifuged for 10 min at 1500×g at 4 °C within 60 min of collection to separate plasma. The plasma will be separated into 2 aliquots in polypropylene screw-cap tubes and placed at -80°C until analysis. All samples will be labeled with patient identification, study identification, sample number, and actual date and time at which the sample was collected. All blood samples will be shipped at the end of the study to Pr. S. Mourah - Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Biologique, Hôpital Saint-Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10. 0142494325 / 0142499336 420 blood collections in 5.0 mL heparinized tubes Moreover, ORR and PFS will be analyzed according to mean trough plasma concentrations and mean peak plasma concentrations of capmatinib over the follow-up. MET expression and amplification study A previous study has shown that MET inhibitors have a direct action in MET driven tumors (independent of the immunomodulatory action of MET inhibitor). ORR and PFS will be analyzed according to baseline expression of MET amplification level in FISH on archival diagnosis tumor sample. The MET amplification will be determined previous the enrollment in each participating center. The patients will be enrolled in cohort 1 if the tumor present < 6 MET gene copies and in cohort 2 if the tumor present  ≥ 6 MET gene copies. Both cohorts will be pooled and analyzed for the primary endpoint to evaluate different threshold of MET gene copies number. Ancillary studies of PD-L1, MMR/MSI and EBV expression The determination of PD-L1 expression, MMR/MSI status and EBV status will be routinely performed on the different investigational site. Local tumor phenotyping data at investigational site will be collected to allow pooled analysis without to have to perform supplementary sample processing. - Contradictory findings have been reported about the predictive value of PD-L1 level of expression for efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric adenocarcinoma. No data have been reported for spartalizumab. The Combined Positive Score (CPS) will be assessed on archival diagnosis tumor sample. - Consistent data suggest that Mismatch Repair deficiency (dMMR) is a strong predictor of efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric and colorectal adenocarcinoma. dMMR will be assessed by IHC of MMR protein and microsatellite status in PCR analysis on archival diagnosis tumor sample. Extracted DNA may be further analyzed with NGS. - EBV status has been reported as predictive factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors. In situ hybridization will be performed to determine EBV tumor status on archival diagnosis tumor sample. ORR and PFS will be analyzed according to these candidate predictive factors: PD-L1 expression, MMR and EBV status. If the determination of these status were not performed on investigational site, an archival tumor bloc will be collected at the end of the study for each patient and stored in the Centre de Ressource Biologique of Saint Louis hospital (Pr Philippe Bertheau / Jihene Benlagha) in order to allow planned ancillary studies. The IHC (PDL-1 and MMR) and FISH (EBV) studies will be performed by the anatomo-pathologic team of Saint Louis hospital (Pr P Bertheau). The MSI status determination by PCR will be performed in the Molecular Oncology Unit of Saint Louis hospital, Paris (Pr J Lehmann-Che). Predictive value of neutrophil count and circulating Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) level It has been suggested that high serum levels of the MET ligand HGF correlated with increasing neutrophil counts and poor responses to checkpoint blockade therapies. We will explore baseline neutrophil count and circulating HGF level and also evolution of both parameters after 3 weeks of treatment with the combination of capmatinib and spartalizumab. ORR and PFS will be analyzed according to baseline neutrophil count and circulating HGF and to evolution of both parameters after one month of treatment. Blood samples of 5.0 mL will be collected into dry tubes with separator (Heparin plasma is not recommended for use in HGF immunoassay) before the beginning of treatment with capmatinib at inclusion and at C2D1, The dosage of HGF will be performed using a human HGF Quantikine ELISA kit (RnD) at laboratory of pharmacogenomic of Saint Louis hospital (Pr S Mourah). This is a multicentric French National study Number of centers: 10 clinical centers of 7 public hospitals or institute located in France Recruitment centres - Saint Louis Hospital, APHP (Paris): Gastroenterology and Digestive Oncology department, CLIPP  and CIC - Centre Léon Bérard (Lyon): Medical  Oncology, CLIPP - Centre Georges Francois Leclerc (Dijon): Medical Oncology, CLIPP and Unité de phase précoce - Gustave Roussy (Villejuif): Digestive Oncology, CLIPP - Institut universitaire du cancer de Toulouse (Toulouse): Medical  Oncology, CLIPP - Hôpital Haut Levêque , (Bordeaux) : Hepato-Gastroenterology and Unité de recherche clinique - Centre Hospitalier Régional Universitaire Jean Minjoz de Besançon : Medical Oncology The recruitment of patient will came directly from gastroenterology or oncology departments of the participating center but also from network of the participating center that referred chemorefractory patients Several situations are possible Temporary suspension of treatment: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the participant’s source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature discontinuation of treatment, but the participant remains enrolled in the study until the end of their participation Premature discontinuation of treatment and withdrawal from the study The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. In the case of severe adverse events, the investigator must notify the sponsor and follow up the participant for 12 months following the premature discontinuation of treatment. Notification of a serious adverse event must be sent by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor. The serious adverse event will be monitored until it is resolved. If a Data Safety Monitoring Board has been created, the committee can specify and/or validate the follow-up methods. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). In case of serious adverse events, see the corresponding section on vigilance The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Adverse reaction Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up A patient will be replace if he did not receive any study treatment The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. The data will be collected prospectively in an electronic Case Report Forms (e-CRF) via a Cleanweb internet browser The investigator will permit the sponsor’s representatives to monitor the study at the frequency defined in the contract, depending on enrolment at each centre. Case Report Forms (CRFs) and related source documents will be reviewed in detail during monitoring visit (completeness, adherence to the guidelines, accuracy compared to source documents). The sponsor’s representative will also review regulatory documents, drug storage and accountability. The investigator must maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all study-related documentation that is suitable for inspection by sponsor’s monitors or representatives of other regulatory agencies.

        "STATISTICAL": "Summary Two cohorts will be constituted for this trial: - Cohort 1 to enroll patients with no MET amplification. Cohort 1 will primarily follow the time-to-event Bayesian optimal phase 2 (TOP) design [Lin, Coleman and Yuan, 2018, Zhou, Lee and Yuan, 2017] for the efficacy assessment of the combination treatment (spartalizumab + capmatinib). Specifically, a maximum total of 81 patients will ensure 90% power with a 5% type I error rate to detect a 30% response rate compared to reference 15%, including an interim analysis after 30 patients have been included with a futility stopping rule of the combination treatment. If the interim futility stooping boundary is crossed for the combination treatment, the inclusion of a 51 additional patients, treated by spartalizumab monotherapy, will ensure >80% power to detect a desirable 20% response rate in these 51 patients treated with spartalizumab monotherapy (against 8% as unacceptable), with a 5% type I error rate (one-sided), using an exact binomial comparison. - Cohort 2 to enroll patients with MET amplification for exploratory purpose only. The enrollment in cohort 2 will be ongoing until cohort 1 is completed. Around 9 patients are expected to be enrolled in cohort 2. The proportion of response (primary endpoint) will be estimated using Bayesian inference. - Across both cohort, an additional close toxicity monitoring will be performed jointly across both cohorts [Ivanova et al.-Clin Invest-2015]. Design In cohort 1, we will primarily monitor the efficacy endpoint using the time-to-event Bayesian optimal phase 2 (TOP) design (Lin, Coleman and Yuan, 2018, Zhou, Lee and Yuan, 2017). Specifically, let 𝑛 denote the interim sample size and 𝑁 denote the maximum sample size. Let 𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓 denote the probability of efficacy (response rate) of the evaluated treatment. For the combination treatment, spartalizumab+capmatinib, we define the null hypothesis 𝐻0: 𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓≤0.15, representing that the combination treatment is inefficacious. We will stop enrolling patients and claim that the treatment is not promising if (𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓>0.15|𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)<𝜆(𝑛/𝑁)𝛼, where 𝜆=0.92 and 𝛼=1 are design parameters optimized to maximize the power under the alternative hypothesis 𝐻1: 𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓=0.3, while controlling the type I error rate at 0.05 (i.e., controlling that the chance of incorrectly claiming that an inefficacious treatment is promising is no more than 5%). Assuming a Beta (0.15,0.85) prior distribution for 𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓, the above decision rule corresponds to the following go/no-go rules during the trial and yields a maximum statistical power of 0.9476 under 𝐻1: Table 1: Go/no-go efficacy rules for cohort 1 *ESS: effective sample size= number of complete observations + (total duration of incomplete observations)/(Duration of observation window, 6 months). As reported in Table 1, we will perform the interim efficacy analysis when the number of enrolled patients, treated with the combination therapy, reaches 30 in cohort 1 and decide on the early stopping rule according to table 1 rules., We will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the combination treatment is promising if the number of responses becomes 18 or more during the trial. Otherwise, and if the combination trial has not been stopped early, we conclude that the combination treatment is not promising if we observe 17 or less responses among the total sample size n=81. Table 2 shows the operating characteristics of the TOP design, under the assumption of pT=0 (no risk of unacceptable toxicity), based on 10000 simulations using the TOP web application, which is available at http://www.trialdesign.org. In the simulation, the assessment window is 6 months, and the patient arrival is uniformly distributed with an accrual rate of 5 patients per month. The time to response is simulated from a Uniform distribution by controlling 50% of the responses occurring in the latter half of the response assessment window. Table 2: Operating characteristics of the design (under the assumption of =0, e.g. no risk of unacceptable toxicity) with N=30 + 51 In case the combination trial is stopped early for futility, we will resume enrolment in cohort 1 for 51 more patients treated spartalizumab monotherapy (up until a total sample size N=81 in cohort 1). From this monotherapy sample of 51 patients, an exact binomial design will allow to conclude to a promising monotherapy with 80% power and 5% one-sided type I error rate, assuming a response rate ≥ 20% as promising and ≤ 8% response rate as undesirable. Specifically, the spartalizumab monotherapy will be claimed promising if 8 or more responses are observed among the 51 patients receiving monotherapy. In cohort 2, we will enroll patients with MET amplification for exploratory purpose only. The enrollment in cohort 2 will be ongoing until cohort 1 is completed. Around 9 patients are expected to be enrolled in cohort 2. The proportion of response (primary endpoint) will be estimated using Bayesian inference. Additionally, we will perform close toxicity monitoring during the trial based on all available information across both cohorts [Ivanova et al.-Clin Invest-2015]. The posterior probability of unacceptable toxicity will be evaluated based on the beta-binomial model y∣ pT ∼binomial(pT) with prior pT ∼Uniform(0,1), where y is the number of patients who experienced unacceptable toxicity under treatment. We plan scheduled safety analyses every 5 completed observations from cohort 1 + 2 (after 5 patients have either completed the two first treatment cycles (C1+C2) or experienced an unacceptable toxicity during C1 or C2) for the 20 first patients than approximately every 10 observations. If at any of the interim safety analyses, the posterior probability that pT>0.25 becomes greater than 0.95 [Prob(pT > 0.25 |data) > 0.95], the trial will be terminated. Table 3 below presents the safety stopping rules at the different analyses. The impact of this additional safety monitoring on the operating characteristics of the design in terms of efficacy conclusions was evaluated by simulation (n=10000) and is limited when the probability of unacceptable toxicity is low: if the true probability of toxicity is pT ≤ 0.20, the probability of concluding to efficacy using the TOP design as defined in table 1 is close 0.05 under 𝐻0:𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓=0.15, and greater than 0.90 under 𝐻1:𝑝𝑒𝑓𝑓=0.3. Nevertheless, when the probability of unacceptable toxicity is higher, e.g. pT =0.30, the trial will be stopped in approximately 49%, and 95% if pT =0.40. Endpoints will be described with count and percentage for categorical endpoints (toxicity, AEs), and with mean, median, 95% confidence interval (or 95% credibility interval if appropriate), interquartile range for continuous endpoints. Time-to event endpoints (PFS and OS) will be estimated using the non-parametric Kaplan Meier estimator, to obtain the survival estimates up to 24 months after inclusion. Analyses will be performed using R statistical platform. Along with data-management, analyses will be conducted in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Information of Hôpital Saint Louis, Paris (Pr Sylvie Chevret), which is a labelled Centre de Traitement des Données INCa. For the primary analysis, in cohort 1, the design will rely on Bayesian methods for the evaluation of spartalizumab + capmatinib combination, and on an exact binomial comparison for the evaluation of spartalizumab monotherapy (in case the combination has been found unpromising). Operating characteristics of the Bayesian TOP design were evaluated in a simulation study and design parameters were calibrated to ensure a 5% risk of erroneously concluding to efficacy. The binomial exact comparison will also have a one-sided 5% type I error risk. No test on the primary endpoint will be performed in cohort 2. In cohort 1, early termination rules will be implemented, both on efficacy and toxicity. For efficacy, an interim analysis will be performed after 30 patients have been included. The stopping criteria are detailed in table 1 above, section 13.1. For safety, sequential monitoring analyses will be performed accounting for both cohorts, every 5 completed observations from cohort 1 + 2 (after 5 patients have either completed the two first treatment cycles (C1+C2) or experienced an unacceptable toxicity during C1 or C2) for the 20 first patients than approximately every 10 observations. If at any of the interim safety analyses, the posterior probability that pT>0.25 becomes greater than 0.95 [Prob(pT > 0.25 |data) > 0.95], the trial will be terminated.

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Randomized prospective Phase III clinical trial comparing HLA 10/10 matched unrelated donor and haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after myeloablative conditioning regimen\nAbbreviated title: MAC-HAPLO-MUD\nCoordinating Investigator: Pr Régis Peffault de Latour\nSponsor: Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: An unrelated adult donor who is HLA-matched to the recipient at the allele-level (at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1) is considered the best choice in the absence of an HLA-matched sibling for patients needing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully HLA-MUD for the non-Caucasian population. Alternative donors (single HLA mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from haploidentical related donors) are still associated with higher non-relapse mortality and delayed immune reconstitution.\nA more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which targets alloreactive T cells generated early after an HLA-mismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and leaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil. From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are  associated with similar overall and progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and thus potentially better results than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning regimen. \nA phase III randomized trial is currently addressing this question in France for elderly patients using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (HaploMUDelederly-01 /PHRC-K 14-045 / PI: D Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes).

        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "An unrelated adult donor who is HLA-matched to the recipient at the allele-level (at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1) is considered the best choice in the absence of an HLA-matched sibling for patients needing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully HLA-MUD for the non-Caucasian population. Alternative donors are used for transplantation in patients without a fully-MUD including single HLA mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from haploidentical related donors but are associated with higher non-relapse mortality and delayed immune reconstitution. A more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which targets alloreactive T cells generated early after an HLA-mismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and leaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil. From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are  associated with similar overall and progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and thus potentially better results than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning regimen. Haplo-SCT with PTCy is thus highly discussed nowadays motivating prospective trials to confirm the benefit of this procedure (ref 1 et ref 2). A phase III randomized trial is currently addressing this question in France for elderly patients (HaploMUDelederly-01 /PHRC-K 14-045 / PI: D Blaise Institut, Paoli Calmettes, NCT 02623309). Few retrospective non-controlled registry studies recently suggest that outcomes after haplo-SCT using PTCy approach might also be superior in terms of GVHD free survival to that after MUD-SCT in the setting of a myeloablative conditioning regimen in adults with high risk hematological malignancies. A randomized prospective Phase III clinical trial comparing HLA 10/10 MUD and haplo-SCT after myeloablative conditioning regimen is thus urgently needed to answer to this question.",
        "PROCEDURE": "As developed before (section 2.2 “Haplo-SCT using T-replete graft after reduced intensity conditioning regimen associated with adequate immunosuppression” part 2), the Baltimore group developed the pT-HDCy using haploidentical related donors with intra-venous injection at day +3 and day +4, using T-replete bone marrow in patients with advanced hematological malignancies (9). High dose, post-transplantation Cy administered early at a fixed time point after bone marrow infusion, has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of GVHD reaction (10). This approach has been used by many French centres using RIC protocols. The SFGM-TC did a report on more than 500 haploidentical related donors HSCT with pT-HDCy mostly done at day+3 and day+4 with an acceptable and expected toxicity profile (the report is accessible on demand). For all those reasons, we decided to used pT-HDCy at day +3 and day +4 intravenously. Phase III multicenter, randomized clinical trial, open, with two parallel arms based on two types of transplantation: Haplo donor myeloablative transplantation (experimental group) or HLA-MUD myeloablative transplantation. 172 patients will be included in each group, ie 344 patients in the whole study. This is a national multi-center study including most adult and paediatric transplant centres of the SFGM-TC (36 centres). Patients will be recruited in the hematology units and referred to the transplant team for the pre-transplant assessment. The screening visit takes place between D-60 and D-30 before transplant. The investigator checks the eligibility criteria and proposes the study to the patient. Information about the protocol is delivered by the transplant physician in charge of the patient No additional test or specific examinations are performed for research. The patient assessment is performed in the usual care of allogeneic transplant. At this visit, the consent of the patient will be collect at the latest by D-15 of transplantation. A Patient Information Sheet and consent form are given to the patient by the investigator; the original is conserved by the investigator and the third copy for the sponsor. Then, patients are randomized for receiving transplant from HLA-MUD or HAPLO-donor. Physical examination - Reports of patient and disease history - ECOG assessment - Sorror score of comorbidities - Complete physical examination with evaluation of tumor localization -Electrocardiogram - Echocardiogram with evaluation of left ventricular ejection - Evaluation of the cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, HBP, obesity, smoking). - Pulmonary function tests including at least Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC)“ -liver ultrasound and doppler echography (baseline values) Biological test - Complete Blood count - Prothrombin time (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) - ABO and Rh typing Blood cell - Chemistry panel (serum electrolytes with creatinine, calcium, glucose, uric acid, magnesium levels, ferritin, CRP) - Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT and bilirubine) - Circulating protein electrophoresis - Pregnancy test (for women of childbearing age) - HLA compatibility check between recipient and donor - Search of anti-HLA antibodies with LUMINEX technology (DSA) - Chimerism markers’ identification Dental radiography Infectious assessment - Urine culture - Viral serologies: Serology for hepatitis B and C, Aspergillus antigen, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV (2 Elisa tests), HTLV-1 and 2, toxoplasmosis (IgG and M), TPHA and VDRL -sinus and thorax CT scan Tumor assessment: Pre-transplant disease evaluation This assessment is performed according to the practice of the investigator. Quality of life Temporary suspension of study procedure: the investigator must document the reason for suspending and resuming the treatment in the subject's source file and the case report form (CRF) Premature termination of study procedure, but the subject remains enrolled in the study until the end of the subject's participation: the investigator must document the reason The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Schedule further follow-up visits, especially in case of a serious adverse event. Subjects may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a subject from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the subject's best interests. The investigator must make every effort to contact subjects lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact such subjects must be documented in the subject’s records (e.g., times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). If a subject exits the trial prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the subject exited or was withdrawn from the study: The investigator should initially complete a SAE reporting form (Appendix 2 ) (contained in the case report form). This report must be signed by the investigator. The investigator must complete every section of the SAE form so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate assessment. The initial report sent to the sponsor must be rapidly followed up by one or more additional written reports describing the course of the event and any complementary information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful for medical assessment of the case (medical reports, laboratory test results, results of additional exams, etc.). These documents must be anonymized. In addition, the investigator must state the study acronym and the number and initials of the study participant on each paper. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the subject has terminated his participation in the trial. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's safety Department by fax only, fax no. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99. For trials which use e-CRF : The investigator completes the SAE report form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints and signs the form before sending it by fax; In case of failure to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign and send the SAE report form to the safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the investigator must complete the SAE report form in the e-CRF. The investigator must comply with all requests for additional information from the sponsor. For all questions relating to an adverse event report, the safety Department can be contacted via email at vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the initial notification and follow-up report forms for pregnancy exposure during trial participation\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy ends, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy, using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy report form, the SAE follow-up forms and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor using the same modalities  as described above. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the mother's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.",

These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the French Criminal Code). During and after the clinical study, all data collected about the study participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be anonymised. Under no circumstances will the names and addresses of the subjects be shown. Only the subject's initials will be recorded, along with an identification code specific to the study indicating the order of enrolment. The sponsor will ensure that each subject has agreed in writing for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed.",
        "STATISTICAL": "The analysis will be based on the intent-to-treat basis, that is, including all randomized patients whatever they were administered the treatment under study or not. Only patient consent withdrawls with positive report of not using their data, if any, will be excluded. One interim analysis will be performed at mid-inclusion, while the terminal analysis will be done once the required number of events (n=146) will be observed. Baseline summary statistics, namely percentages or median [interquartile range, IQR], will be computed in each randomized arm, without any statistical test of comparison. The right censored endpoint will be estimated using nonparametric methods. Kaplan Meier curves and cumulative incidence curves will be considered in case of non informative or informative censoring with comparison across randomized arms based on the log-rank test or the Gray test, respectively. Adjustment on potential confounders will used Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical analyses will be performed on SAS (SAS Inc, Cary, NC) and R (https://www.R-project.org/) software packages. The type I error is fixed at =0.05. An interim analysis will be performed at mid-inclusion. It will be based on the Bayesian computation of stopping rules based on the modeling of the log Hazard ratio (HR), denoted  , of the main endpoint (Spiegelhalter 1994). It will be based on the posterior probability of , conditional on the data accumulated at the time of interim analysis. We will evaluate the two following criteria: γ_0=P(θ<logHR_0│data)>0.95 γ_1=P(θ>logHR_1│data)>0.95 where HR_0 =1 and HR_1=0.62 denote the value of the hazard ratio postulated in the null and alternate hypotheses, respectively. The posterior densities of the logHR,  will be computed using MCMC methods. Non informative prior of the logHR,  will be considered."

Improved survival has been achieved in patients younger than 40 years old, thanks to better donor selection, conditioning regimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, together with improved supportive care. \nHowever, this has never been the case for patients over the age of 40 for whom the overall survival after HSCT never exceeded 60% at 5 years using available sibling or unrelated donor (Ref#3). Thus, the standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) associating cisclosporine, horse anti-thymocyte globuline, together with the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG) is now considered as the standard of care in adult patients older than 40 years with AA (ref#1).\n\nIndeed, outcomes for patients who are refractory to first-line IST remain poor because of the lack of other non-transplant treatment and because of the poor results of transplantation at this age (Ref#2, 37). During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in this population after initial IST but risk of hemorrhage and long-term fatigue are still present. Moreover, clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis for MDS/AML (Ref#2). The overall survival of such adult patients with acquired AA refractory or in relapse after IST outside HSCT is thus about 60% at 2 years (ref #2).\n\nRecently, new strategies to prevent acute and chronic graft versus host disease, including T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have revolutionized the field.\nThese changes extended the option of HSCT primary for patients with refractory/relapse AA who lack an HLA matched donor (Ref#4). More recently the optimized Baltimore protocol using PTCy strategy also appears to improve engraftment and reduce graft versus host disease (GvHD) in other more classical setting (sibling and matched unrelated HSCT outside AA) (Ref#5).  One of the first cause of death after HSCT in patients older than 40 years of age with refractory/relapse AA is GvHD and the use of the optimized Baltimore protocol for all type of donors (haplo but also sibling and matched unrelated transplantation) within the field of AA rapidly appears promising (Ref#6&7). \n\nUsing an optimized HSCT procedure (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent drastically GvHD and eventually be practice changing. Evaluating this new transplant protocol as a new strategy is the main objective of “APARR”.\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: To demonstrate a benefit in terms of the 2-year GRFS (Graft Versus Host Disease {GvHD} and primary and secondary graft failure-Free Survival) from 50% (historical rates in patients with refractory/relapse AA undergoing HSCT (REF#8) up to 70% using an optimized HSCT procedure (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) on patients over 40 years old and not only in haplo-identical donor setting. \nPrimary endpoint: 2-year GRFS following HCST\nThis primary composite endpoint is measured as the time from HSCT to the first of the following events: primary and secondary graft failures, grade 3-4 acute GVHD, severe chronic GVHD and

HSCT is the sole therapeutically valid option but results have always been very disappointing and transplantation is currently rarely possible.  An optimized HSCT protocol not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent GvHD and eventually drastically improve the outcome of HSCT in patients older than 40 years with refractory/relapse AA. \nThere are direct benefits for patients since no curative and safe options are available so far. In the absence of transplantation, patients aged 40 years or more with refractory/relapse AA after IST are thus exposed to infections risk, hemorrhage, prolonged fatigue but also on the long-term clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) as well as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), both with a grim prognosis.\nA global health care benefit will also be possible since those patients won’t need any more medical support including hospitalization but also daily hospital care (antibiotics or need for transfusions).\nRisks and burdens added by the study: Rituximab injection\nRisk level of the study: D\nPractical implementation: Indication of HSCT in patients with refractory/relapse AA aged more than 40 years who are refractory or in relapse after first-line IST\nNumber of participants included: 52 patients\nNumber of centres: 28 centers affiliated at SFGM-TC in France\nDuration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months\nParticipation period (BMT + follow-up): 24 months \nTotal duration: 60 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0,05 patient/centre/month\nStatistical analysis: Sample size calculation\nA two-sided, one-sample log-rank test calculated from a sample of 52 subjects achieves 80% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a 2-years GRFS of 70% in the new group when the 2-years GRFS in the historic control group is 50% if all patients are followed 2 years.\n\nAnalysis of primary endpoint\nSeveral interim analyses of the primary outcome measure are planned once every 12 months (unless less than 20 enrolled patients), based on a Bayesian approach.\nAt the end of the trial (accrual+follow-up), GRFS will be estimated using Kaplan Meier method with its corresponding 95% confidence interval and compared to historical rate using one sample two-sided log-rank test.\n\nAn additional terminal analysis will use external patients from an observational cohort, with propensity score weighting, to ensure an unbiased comparison and enhance the level of evidence of the treatment effect.\nFunding sources: PHRC-N 2022\nStudy will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board: Yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Outcomes for adult patients with aplastic anemia (AA) and aged more than 40 years who are refractory or in relapse after first-line IST remain poor. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the sole therapeutically valid option but results have always been very disappointing and transplantation is rarely possible because of unacceptable toxicity. Using an optimized HSCT protocol (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent GvHD and eventually drastically improve the outcome of HSCT in patients with refractory/relapse AA after IST. Overall survival is not reflecting anymore the main goal in older patients undergoing HSCT. Considering beyond simple OS, the use of GRFS (Graft Versus Host Disease (GvHD) and Relapse/rejection-Free Survival) may thus be a more meaningful clinical study endpoint by allowing for greater accuracy in assessing patient outcomes and thus benefits from the experimental approach. The main hypothesis of this study is that, in patients aged 40 years or above, with refractory/relapsed AA, applying a new HSCT strategy based on marrow stem cells, whichever the donor type (haplo-identical, related or unrelated donor), together with a haplo-identical conditioning platform with PTCy, may be beneficial, in terms of the 2-year GRFS - that should increase from 50% (historical controls, ref#8) to 70%. This primary composite endpoint is measured as the time from HSCT to first of four events: primary and secondary graft failures, grade 3-4 acute GVHD, severe chronic GVHD and death.",
        "OBJECTIVES": "The main objective is to demonstrate a benefit in terms of the 2-year GRFS (Graft Versus Host Disease {GvHD} and primary and secondary graft failure-Free Survival) from 50 % (historical rates in patients with refractory/relapse AA undergoing standard HSCT using bone marrow from a related/unrelated donor (REF#8)) up to 70 % using an optimized HSCT protocol (bone marrow as source of stem cells and a haplo-identical conditioning platform including PTCy) on patients over 40 years old and not only in haplo-identical donor setting. The secondary objectives will evaluate the following clinical and biological outcomes: - primary and secondary graft failure -  mortality, overall survival -  quality of life - treatment related morbidity and notably severe infections, cardiac toxicities - chimerism - immune reconstitution",
        "METHODOLOGY": "2-year GRFS. GRFS is a composite right-censored endpoint, defined as the time from HSCT to the first of the following events: primary graft failure, defined as the absence of engraftment from aplasia at day 60 after graft (D0) (i.e., persistence of neutrophils< 500 AND platelets < 20 Giga/L) secondary graft failure, defined as the reoccurrence of aplasia after engraftment (defined as both occurrence of neutrophils< 500 for 3 days and platelets < 20 Giga/L for 7 consecutive days) grade 3-4 acute GVHD, according to the MAGIC CONSORTIUM 2016 severe chronic GVHD, according to the NIH classification death, whatever the cause 100-day engraftment (3 consecutive days with neutrophils >0.5 G/L and 7 consecutive days with platelets >20 G/L) with donor chimerism> 85% on the total blood.

        "PROCEDURE": "A phase II multicenter, French, single-arm trial. This is a national multi-center study including adult transplant centers of the SFGM-TC (28 centres). Recruitment centres Patients will be recruited in the hematology units and referred to the transplant team for the pre-transplant assessment. At this visit, the consent of the patient will be collected at the latest by D-10 before transplant. A Patient Information Sheet and consent form are given to the patient by the investigator; the original is conserved by the investigator and the third copy for the sponsor. Patients, after signing written informed consent, will be included by the investigators on eCRF CleanWebTM. The physician will receive a confirmation of the inclusion by email. The patient assessment is performed in the usual care of allogeneic transplant. Data collected for the research: Physical examination - Reports of patient and disease history including biology, diagnosis, specific AA treatments - Weight and height - ECOG performans status assessment - Sorror score of comorbidities - Complete physical examination - HLA compatibility check between recipient and donor - Pre-transplant bone marrow aspiration for smear and cytogenetics done before inclusion (within 6 to 8 weeks) -Electrocardiogram done at screening visit or no less than 2 months before inclusion - Echocardiogram with evaluation of left ventricular ejection done at screening visit or no less than 2 months before inclusion. - Evaluation of the cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, HBP, obesity, diabetes, smoking) done at screening visit. - Pulmonary function tests including at least Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC) done at screening visit or no less than 2 months before inclusion - Respiratory function tests done at screening visit or no less than 2 months before inclusion - Liver ultrasound and doppler echography (baseline values) Biological test - Complete Blood count: neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, haemoglobin, platelet (screening and inclusion visit) - ABO and Rh typing Blood cell - Chemistry panel (serum electrolytes with creatinine, calcium, glucose, uric acid, magnesium levels, ferritin, CRP) - Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT and bilirubine) - Circulating protein electrophoresis - Four pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential) before starting any treatment* - Search of anti-HLA antibodies with LUMINEX technology (DSA) - Chimerism markers’ identification - Marrow aspiration with Karyotype analysis within 6 to 8 weeks before HSCT * Serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL (for women of childbearing potential) can be used indifferently. Infectious assessment - Viral serologies: Serology for hepatitis B (Antigen HBs, Ig antiHBc) and C, Aspergillus antigen, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV (2 Elisa tests), HTLV-1 and 2 (IgG), toxoplasmosis (IgG and M), TPHA and VDRL - PCR: HIV, B and C hepatitis Imaging - Dental radiography - Total body CT scan This assessment is performed according to the practice of the investigator. Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30- v3) Preservation of the fertility: a. For women: it may be proposed a stimulation for the collection of follicles and secondary ovocytes in order to realize either gamete vitrification or in vitro fertilisation followed by embryo preservation (technique reserved for couples). As with cryopreservation of gonadal tissue, the stimulation and transvaginal punctures required for these techniques may be contraindicated by thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. In a woman with a stable partner, embryo freezing is theoretically possible but rarely compatible with the emergency of management. b. For men: it is essential to propose a consultation at the CECOS (Centre for the Study and Conservation of Sperm) for the collection and cryopreservation of sperm. The protocol is carried out by the French aplastic anemia of reference centre and the Société Francophone de Greffe de Moëlle et de Thérapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) so most of the members of SFGM-TC will participate to this research. The French biomedicine agency and patients’ association also support this proposal. Refractory aplastic anemia for this study population concerns about 30% of the 150 new patients per year (60% of patients aged 40 years or more) receiving immunosuppression (anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine and Eltrombopag) for this disease in the French Reference / SFGM-TC network, which illustrates the feasibility of the study. The transplant procedure, once started, cannot be interrupted unless the patient dies. So, there is no particular disposition /procedure in case of prematurely terminating the transplant procedure. In case of occurrence of an adverse reaction and in the physician’s opinion requiring treatment discontinuation as described in the SmPC of Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil. Medical management care: For the MMF, it will be stopped or decreased faster in case of unexpected prolonged cytopenias and in case of digestive disorders (diarrhea). For the tacrolimus, it will be stopped in case of severe hepatic and renal insufficiency and replaced by corticosteroides at 0.5mg/kg (day 7 to 14), 1mg/kg (day 15 to 29), 0.5mg/kg (day 30 to 45), 0.25mg/kg (day 46 to 60), taper to zero (day 61 to 84) (Ref #39). If hepatic and renal function improve, tacrolimus will be reintroduced at half dose. This will be discussed at Multidisciplinary meetings. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. They will be followed in any case as part of a classic care follow-up. Before procedure of graft, the investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraw a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. If the transplant procedure has been initiated, then the patient will not be discharged from the study. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely by withdrawing consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Another medical issue Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up Death The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be non-identifying. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial notification, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by email (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr). It should be noted that it is possible to send SAE reports to the Safety Department by fax to +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in the event of a failed attempt to send the SAE report by email (in order to avoid duplication). For studies which use e-CRFs the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy. Data entry will be performed by each centre by authorized persons. The computer file used for this research is implemented in accordance with French (amended “Informatique et Libertés” law governing data protection) and European (General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR) regulations. Commitment to comply with “Reference Methodology” MR-001: This research is governed by the CNIL (French Data Protection Agency) “Reference Methodology for processing personal data used within the scope of health research” (amended MR-001).

        "DATA MANAGEMENT": "The persons responsible for the quality control of clinical studies (Article L.1121-3 of the Code de la Santé Publique [French Public Health Code]) will take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of information relating to the investigational medicinal products, the study, the study participants and in particular their identity and the results obtained. These persons, as well as the investigators themselves, are bound by professional secrecy (in accordance with the conditions set out in Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the Code Pénal [French Criminal Code]). During and after the research involving human participants, all data collected concerning the participants and sent to the sponsor by the investigators (or any other specialised collaborators) will be rendered non-identifying. Under no circumstances shall the names and addresses of the participants involved be shown. Only the participant’s initials will be recorded, accompanied by an encoded number specific to the study indicating the order of enrolment. The sponsor will ensure that each participant has given written permission for any personal information about him or her which is strictly necessary for the quality control of the study to be accessed. Non-identifying data will be entered electronically via a web browser.",
        "STATISTICAL": "Several interim analyses are planned (see below). The interim and primary analyses will be performed on the ITT population. A secondary analysis will be performed on the per-protocol population Descriptive statistics will present median and interquartile range, or mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and count and percentages for qualitative variables Interim analyses The interim analyses will take place every 12 months, unless less than 20 enrolled patients. They will use a Bayesian inference frawework. We will compute the posterior mean and a credible band for the GRF survival function, as well as the posterior mean for the hazard of event, from a piecewise exponential prior with Gamma distributed independent heights (Castillo and Van der Pas (2020). Multiscale Bayesian survival analysis. <arXiv:2005.02889). Assuming an exponential GRFS distribution, we will compute the posterior probability that the hazard of event is above -0.03 (corresponding to the expected survival of 50% at month 24). These results will be provide to the DSMB as a toll for decision making. The R Package ‘BayesSurvival’ will be used. Primary endpoint analysis The primary endpoint (GRFS) will be estimated and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, along with its 95% Confidence Interval using Greenwood’s formula. The 2-year GRF rate estimation will be compared to the historical rate using a one sample, two-sided log-rank test. Secondary endpoints All time to event endpoints with no competing risks (that is, assuming a non-informative censoring) will be analysed similarly to GRFS. For time to event endpoints with competing risk setting, cumulative incidence of the endpoint will be estimated in a competing-risks setting, plotted with its corresponding 95%CI. For binary endpoints, proportion will be calculated with its corresponding exact binomial 95%CI For quantitative endpoints, summary statistics (median and IQR or mean and SD) will be presented. Subgroup analyses Two subgroups of interest are defined based on the type of HSCT donor: 1/ haplo-identical HSCT donors 2/ sibling or matched unrelated donors Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints, and the additional PS-based analysis (see below) will be repeated specifically for these 2 subgroups. Interaction tests of Gail and Simon will be used. PS-based analysis To enhance the level of evidence of this single arm trial, we will add a comparison to external controls (#Ref 34-35). With access to individual patient data from an observational cohort (#Ref 8), we will perform a causal inference analysis with Propensity Score (PS) weighting analysis (#Ref 36). Primary endpoint and secondary endpoints will be compared between patients from the trial and patients from the cohort and using IPW methods (with ATT weights). The propensity score will include already known prognostic factors, among which time between diagnosis and BMT, age, type of donor and disease type at time of BMT and observed prognostic factors. Effect of GRFS will be compared using a Cox proportional hazard weighted model. For secondary time-to-event endpoints, either Cox or Cox-cause specific weighted models will be used, depending on the presence of competing risks. For binary endpoints, weighted logistic model will be used."

        "SUMMARY": "Full title: Haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in patients with acquired refractory aplastic anemia: a nationwide phase II study\nAcronym/reference: HAPLO-EMPTY\nCoordinating investigator: Pr Régis Peffault de latour\nSponsor: Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris\nScientific justification: Outcomes for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are refractory to first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and who lack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor. Recently, the use of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in 40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not respond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore exposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis. Overall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired refractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years (2).\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative donor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood (CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in patients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of complications than in transplantations from matched related or unrelated donors. Recently, our group showed that CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA (3). However, not all patients have available CB and CBT treatment related mortality is high in adult patients. Haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Preliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory SAA at Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA) seem promising (4, 5). We retrospectively analyzed data from 36 patients (median age 42 years) transplanted between 2010 and 2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation group. The 1-year overall survival was about 80% suggesting that this approach might be a valid option in this particular poor clinical situation (6).\nMain objective and primary endpoint: Main objective: to demonstrate a benefit in term of the 2-year overall survival rate from 60% (historical rates in patients with acquired refractory idiopathic aplastic anemia) up to 80% using haplo-SCT with PTCy.\n\nPrimary endpoint: 2-year overall survival rate of 80%\nSecondary objectives and endpoints: Secondary objectives\nClinical and biological outcomes:\n- Graft failure, Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD), progression free survival, relapse, non-relapse mortality, Overall Survival\n- Quality of life\n- Chimerism\n- Immune reconstitution \n\nSecondary Endpoints: \nGraft failure incidence\nNeutrophils and platelets engraftment at day 100 (3 consecutive days with neutrophiles >0.5 G/L and 7 consecutive days with platelets >20 G/L)\n Absolute numbers of neutrophils and platelets at M1, M2, M3, M6 and M12, day of last platelet and red blood cell transfusions\nIncidence of use of growth factors for poor hematopoietic reconstitution\nAcute GvHD incidence at month 3 (M3) (date and maximum grading, first line treatment, response to steroids, treatment courses in case of steroid refractory GvHD).\nChronic GvHD incidence (date and grading) at M24.\nRelapse incidence at M12 and M24 \nProgression free survival at M12 and M24\nIncidence of CMV and EBV infection at M12\nSevere infections (CTAE grade 3-4) à M3, M6, M12 and M24\nNon-relapse mortality M24\nIncidence of cardiac toxicities at M12\nOverall survival at M12\nQuality of life questionnaire at inclusion, post-transplantation, M3, M6, M12, M24\nChimerism at M1, M3, M6, M12,M24 \nImmune reconstitution by analyzing T, B, NK, regulatory T cell levels in the peripheral blood at M3, M6, M12 and M24 post-transplantation\nFerritin levels at  M3, M6, M12, M24\nDesign of the study: A phase II multicenter, national, prospective cohort study.\nPopulation of study participants: Patients aged from 3 to 35 years with acquired refractory idiopathic aplastic anemia and with an indication of an haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\nInclusion criteria: Patients:\nAged from 3 to 35 years old\nSuffering from refractory acquired idiopathic aplastic anemia (at least one course of immunosuppression with  anti-thymocyte globulin\nAbsence of geno-identical donor or 10/10 matched donor\nWith identification of a haploidentical donor (brother, sister,   parents, adult children or cousin)\n- Absence of donor specific antibody detected in the patient with a MFI ≥ 1500 (antibodies directed towards the distinct haplotype between donor and recipient)\nWith usual criteria for HSCT:\nECOG ≤ 2\nNo severe and uncontrolled infection\nCardiac function compatible with high dose of cyclophosphamide \nAdequate organ function: ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2.5N, total bilirubin ≤ 2N, creatinine < 150 µmol/L \nWith health insurance coverage\nContraception methods must be prescribed during all the duration of the research.

In absence of GvHD, MMF will be stopped at D35 and tacrolimus at day 365.\n\n4/ Prevention of EBV reactivation \nRituximab 150mg/m2 intravenously at Day+5 post HSCT, \nEach infusion of Rituximab will be preceded by administration of anti-pyretic and an antihistaminic, e.g. paracetamol and diphenhydramine.\nInterventions added for the study: No additional test or specific examinations\nExpected benefits for the participants and for society: Outcomes for patients with SAA who are refractory to first-line IST and who lack a MUD remain poor. Transplantation is the sole therapeutically valid option. CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults but mortality using this approach is high for adult patients and CB is not always available. Haplo-SCT with PTCy recently showed promising results in this situation and nearly all patients have an available haplo donor (all biologic parents and children of a patient are haplo and each sibling has a 50% chance of being haplo). Moreover, haplo-SCT with PTCy is not only available for almost all patients but also a quick and cheap procedure. This study might thus demonstrate haplo-SCT with PTCy to be a curative option of adult patients with refractory aplastic anemia or children/young patients with no CBT available.\nRisks and burdens added by the study: Risks are related to the SCT itself. Cardiac toxicities and hemorrhagic cystitis will be particularly monitored.\nPractical implementation: Indication of allograft in context of acquired refractory aplastic anemia\nNumber of participants included: For an objective of 31 patients to be allo-grafted, we anticipate 35 patients to include.\nNumber of centres: 36 centres in France\nDuration of the study: Inclusion period: 36 months\nParticipation period (post-transplant): 24 months\nTotal duration: 60 months\nNumber of enrolments expected per site and per month: 0.3 patient/year/centre (0,02 patient/month/centre)\nStatistical analysis: Justification of sample size\nWe hypothesize the 2-year overall survival (OS) will be of 80% (versus 60% in historical controls). A two-sided, one-sample logrank test calculated from a sample of 31 subjects achieves 80.7% power at a 0.050 significance level to detect a proportion OS of 80% in the new group when the proportion OS in the historic control group is 60% at 2 years.\n\nTerminal analysis \nWill be realized after the observation of the required number of events\nFunding sources: Ministry of Health - PHRC-N 2019\nStudy will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board: Yes",
        "SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION": "Outcomes for patients with SAA who are refractory to first-line IST and who lack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor. Recently, the use of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in 40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not respond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore exposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. Moreover, refractory patients have a higher risk of clonal evolution (MDS, LAM) and are also exposed to PNH evolution. Overall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired refractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years (2). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative donor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood (CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in patients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of complications than in transplantations from matched related or unrelated donors (3).

        "PROCEDURE": "A phase II multicenter, national, prospective cohort study. This is a national multi-center study including all adult and pediatric transplant centres of the SFGM-TC 36 centres). Patients will be recruited in the hematology units and referred to the transplant team for the pre-transplant assessment. At this visit, the consent of the patient will be collected at the latest by D-10 before haplo-SCT. A Patient Information Sheet and consent form are given to the patient by the investigator; the original is conserved by the investigator and the third copy for the sponsor. Patients, after signing written informed consent, will be included by the investigators on eCRF CleanWebTM. The physician will receive a confirmation of the inclusion by email. Physical examination - Reports of patient and disease history - ECOG assessment - Sorror score of comorbidities - Complete physical examination -Electrocardiogram - Echocardiogram with evaluation of left ventricular ejection - Evaluation of the cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, HBP, obesity, smoking). - Pulmonary function tests including at least Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC)“ - Liver ultrasound and doppler echography (baseline values) Biological test - Complete Blood count - Prothrombin time (PT), Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) - ABO and Rh typing Blood cell - Chemistry panel (serum electrolytes with creatinine, calcium, glucose, uric acid, magnesium levels, ferritin, CRP) - Liver function tests (transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-GT and bilirubine) - Circulating protein electrophoresis - Two pregnancy tests (for women of childbearing age) before starting any treatment* - Search of anti-HLA antibodies with LUMINEX technology (DSA) - Chimerism markers’ identification - Marrow aspiration with Karyotype analysis in the 6 weeks before HSCT * The young girl will be considerate as women of childbearing age following menarche, so pregnancy tests will be performed from the menarche. Serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL(for women of childbearing age) can be used indifferently for young girl. Infectious assessment - Urine culture - Viral serologies: Serology for hepatitis B and C, Aspergillus antigen, EBV (IgG and M), CMV (IgG and M), HSV (IgG and M), HIV (2 Elisa tests), HTLV-1 and 2, toxoplasmosis (IgG and M), TPHA and VDRL Imaging : - Dental radiography - Total body CT scan This assessment is performed according to the practice of the investigator. Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30- v3) and QQL Ped for minor Preservation of the fertility : 1/ Fertility preservation in girls and boys before puberty (Dalle JH et al, 2017). Before menarche in the girl and before the age of 12-13 years and a Tanner stage P3-T3, it is not possible to consider preserving gametes. Only cryopreservation of gonadal tissue can be considered. These may not be feasible in cases of profound thrombocytopenia or neutropenia due to the high risk of bleeding or infection. a. For prepubertal girl: cryopreservation of the ovarian cortex, the area containing the oocytes, has been proposed for about 20 years. Pregnancies have been reported after hetero or orthotopic reimplantation of the frozen tissue after allograft for non-malignant pathologybut this is still experimental. b. For prepubertal boys: it is possible to propose testicular pulp cryopreservation, but as this only contains spermatogonia or spermatozoa from the pubertal period onwards, this is an experimental technique with no practical application to date. 2/ Preservation of fertility in the pubertal subject: a. For women: it may be proposed a stimulation for the collection of follicles and secondary ovocytes in order to realize either gamete vitrification or in vitro fertilisation followed by embryo preservation (technique reserved for couples). As with cryopreservation of gonadal tissue, the stimulation and transvaginal punctures required for these techniques may be contraindicated by thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. In a woman with a stable partner, embryo freezing is theoretically possible but rarely compatible with the emergency of management. b. For men: it is essential to propose a consultation at the CECOS (Centre for the Study and Conservation of Sperm) for the collection and cryopreservation of sperm. The protocol is carried out by the French aplastic anemia of reference centre and the Société Francophone de Greffe de Moëlle et de Thérapie Cellulaire (SFGM-TC) (adult and pediatric centres), so most of the members of SFGM-TC will participate to this research. The French biomedicine agency and patients association also support this proposal. Refractory aplastic anemia concerns about 30% of the 150 new patients per year receiving immunosuppression for this disease in the French Reference / SFGM-TC network, which illustrates the feasibility of the study The transplant procedure started cannot be interrupted unless the patient dies. The investigator must: Document the reason(s) Collect the assessment criteria at the time of ending participation in the study, if the participant agrees Schedule a follow-up for the participant, particularly in case of a serious adverse event. Participants may exit the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator can temporarily or permanently withdraws a participant from the study for any safety reason or if it is in the participant’s best interests. Participant lost to follow-up: the participant cannot be located. The investigator must make every effort to reconnect with the participant (and document his attempts in the source file), at least to determine whether the participant is alive or dead If a participant exits the study prematurely or withdraws consent, any data collected prior to the date of premature exit may still be used. If a participant exits the study prematurely, and if the participant agrees, state the procedure and schedule for collecting the data required by the protocol (primary endpoint, secondary endpoints, safety assessment) (NB: this must be stated in the information and consent form) State how premature exit from the study will affect the participant's ongoing care (state exactly what the participant will be offered). The case report form must list the various reasons why the participant has discontinued the study: Lack of efficacy Death Another medical issue Personal reasons of the participant Explicit withdrawal of consent Lost to follow-up The initial notification of an SAE must be provided in a written report signed by the investigator using a SAE notification form specific to the study and intended for this purpose (in the case report form). Each item in this form must be completed by the investigator so that the sponsor can carry out the appropriate analysis. The initial notification to the sponsor of a serious adverse event must be quickly followed by an additional detailed written report (or reports) so that the case outcome may be monitored by the Safety Department or to provide further information. Whenever possible, the investigator will provide the sponsor with any documents that may be useful (medical reports, laboratory test results, results from additional examinations, etc.). These documents must be de-identified. In addition, the documents must include the following: study acronym, number and participant’s initials. Any adverse event will be monitored until fully resolved (stabilisation at a level considered acceptable by the investigator, or return to the previous state) even if the participant has left the study. The initial report, the SAE follow-up reports and all other documents must be sent to the sponsor's Safety Department by e-mail (eig-vigilance.drc@aphp.fr) to the sponsor’s safety department. It is possible to send the SAE to the Safety department by fax to the sponsor’s safety department, fax No. +33 (0)1 44 84 17 99 only in case of unsuccessful attempt to send the SAE by e-mail and in order to avoid duplicates For studies which use e-CRF : the investigator completes the SAE notification form in the e-CRF, then validates, prints, and signs the form before sending it by email; if it is not possible to connect to the e-CRF, the investigator should complete, sign, and send the SAE notification form to the Safety Department. As soon as the connection is restored, the SAE notification form in the e-CRF must be duly completed. The investigator must respond to all requests from the sponsor for additional information. For all questions relating to the notification of an adverse event, the Safety Department can be contacted via email: vigilance.drc@aphp.fr. For cases of in utero exposure, the investigator will complete the Notification and Follow-up form for a pregnancy occurring during participation in a study\". The investigator must monitor the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy or until the pregnancy is terminated, and must notify the sponsor of the outcome of the pregnancy using this form. If the outcome of the pregnancy falls within the definition of a serious adverse event (miscarriage, pregnancy termination, foetal death, congenital abnormality, etc.), the investigator must follow the procedure for reporting SAEs. The initial pregnancy notification, the SAE follow-up reports, and any other documents will be sent to the sponsor according to the same procedures specified herein. If it was the father who was exposed, the investigator must obtain the pregnant woman's permission before collecting information about the pregnancy.
