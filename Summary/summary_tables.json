            "Expected benefits for the participants and for society",
            "Refractory non-infectious uveitis is a serious ocular pathology, accounting for 10-15% of total blindness cases. Reliable clinical data are required for the treatment of uveitis and more particularly in the use of biotherapies. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have shown a sustained remission rate of 70% in severe refractory/relapsing uveitis. The incidence of blindness in UNI has been reduced in recent years with the use of biotherapies, raising the question of whether these therapies should be prescribed earlier in the management of patients with severe non-infectious uveitis. Compared to conventional immunosuppressants, biotherapies are fast acting and highly effective in corticosteroids sparing, thus limiting the risk of cataract and/or cortico-induced glaucoma. FOCUS is the first randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of adalimumab to standard of care (mycophenolate mofetil) in the maintenance treatment of corticosteroid-dependent UNI. This study will validate and optimize the treatment of hard-to-treat patients with uveitis. It may also confirm whether or not adalimumab is superior to mycophenolate mofetil in terms of efficacy. It will allow a direct comparison of the safety profiles of these treatments. It could significantly improve the management of patients with corticosteroid-dependent UNI and finally help in the selection of the best treatment to prevent the onset of blindness and side effects in these difficult to treat cases. The expected benefit is both individual, by reducing morbidity for patients with non-infectious uveitis, and collective, by reducing the costs of unemployment, disability and hospitalization caused by UNI."

To demonstrate that the prevalence is two-fold that observed in non-responders, with a type I error at 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, the sample size is tabulated below according to the prevalence of response.\nThus, to anticipate for potential large disproportion in responders/non responders (that will be only defined after study inclusion) we decided to include 205 patients. This will allow to control for type I and type II error rates in the comparison of the prevalence of CYP2C19 UM profile among these groups. In addition the sample size will allow to study sufficient numbers of CYP2D6 PM, IM, and UM to determine the effects of CYP2D6 variations on V and ODV plasma levels and their efficacy or risk of adverse events.\nThe type I error rate will be fixed at 0.05. All tests will be two-sided and compared thus to 0.05.\nMultiple imputations, which are a popular approach for handling the pervasive problem of missing data in biostatistics, will be used. It is usually performed under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. Multiple imputations by chained equation are to our knowledge the most flexible approach to handle complex patterns of missing data (including categorical data, quantitative data, and survival data).\nPrimary analyses will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.\nSecondary exploratory analyses will consider the population of compliers, that is, those who completed the treatment according to the scheduled protocol."

            "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Most of the patients requiring an allo-HSCT are above 50 years of age and are transplanted with a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. The optimal RIC and GVHD prophylaxis regimen allowing a good control of the disease while preventing GVHD remains to be determined for elderly patients. A phase III trial comparing the conventional RIC fludarabine-busulfan 2 days to fludarabine-treosulfan demonstrated an advantage for the flu-treosulfan arm in terms of event free survival (EFS), that should therefore be considered as the new standard of RIC regimen for AML and MDS. GVHD prevention has a crucial role in post-transplant outcomes by potentially interfering with the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and immune reconstitution. Anti-thymocyte globulins (ATG) are recommended to reduce the risk of acute and chronic GVHD in transplants performed with matched unrelated donors. However, the optimal type of ATG between the 2 approved brands (ATG-thymoglobulin and ATLG-grafalon) displaying distinct characteristics and the optimal dose of ATG are still unknown. In a retrospective study of patients transplanted mainly with RIC with matched related and unrelated donors for haematological malignancies, we observed that ATLG was associated with a reduction of grade II-IV acute GVHD in comparison to ATG without increasing the incidence of relapse. \nIn this phase III randomized study, we propose to compare GVHD prevention with ATG versus ATLG in AML and MDS patients above 50 years of age transplanted with a matched unrelated donor following a fludarabine-treosulfan RIC, with the hypothesis that ATLG would better control GVHD in this population of patients thus limiting the risk of morbidity and mortality of the procedure."

            "The only curative treatment in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCT). It has been reported that intermediate and higher risk patients according to international prognostic scores benefit from HSCT in terms of survival (Kröger et al, 2015). In 2013, we conducted in France a prospective trial testing the use of ruxolitinib before transplantation (“JAK-ALLO study” NCT01795677). Outcome of patients was better in patients transplanted with a matched sibling donor than an unrelated donor confirming other studies (Kröger et al, 2009; Rondelli et al, 2014). In the JAK-ALLO trial, acute GVHD incidence was high, often hyperacute and severe. Recently, the EBMT group has reported a registry study on familial haplo-identical transplantation (haplo) in patients with myelofibrosis (Raj et al, 2018). Post-transplant cyclophosphamide was used in 59% of cases. One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 61 and 58% which favorably compared to outcome after unrelated transplantation. Genova team has also reported impressive results after haplo-identical transplantation in their center (Bregante et al, 2015). Bregante et al have reported outcome of 2 cohorts transplanted from 2000 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2014. The main difference between the 2 periods is the more frequent use of haplo in the second period (54% versus 5%). Outcome was much better in the second period with OS at 70% versus 49% and authors suggest that this improvement is related to the best outcome among haplo transplantation. The improvement of outcome after haplo has been attributed to a better GVHD prophylaxis, especially with the use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. Given the poor outcome after unrelated transplantation and especially in HLA mismatched unrelated setting and encouraging results in family haplo identical transplantation, this current study proposes to test haplo-identical transplantation in myelofibrosis patients without a matched related donor."

            "Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as COVID-19. On the 22nd March 2020, 2920142 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 12784 deaths were reported by The World Health Organization (1). On the 31 March 2020, there were 52827 severe cases in France, including 3532 deaths. The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical. If most infections are not severe, 15% of infected patients will require hospitalization and 5% will require intensive care unit admission (2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on clinical symptoms and microbiological testing. To test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, testing centers use a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) on nasal swab in patients with productive cough. A number of investigational agents are being explored for antiviral treatment of COVID-19. However, to date, there are no controlled data supporting the use of any specific treatment (anti-viral drugs or immunomodulatory drugs), and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown (3).\nSARS-CoV-2 infects human cells through the binding of its spike (S) protein to the membranous aminopeptidase called ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2). Among other tissues, ACE2 expression has mainly been found on pneumocytes, enterocytes, renal tubular cells and podocytes. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 requires S protein priming by cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which entails S protein cleavage and allows fusion of viral and cellular membranes (4). In a murine model of SARS-CoV pneumonia, Iwata-Yoshikawa et al. showed that TMPRSS2-KO mice had weakened inflammatory cytokine responses and reduced lung injury than control mice (5). Hoffmann et al. found that a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, the camostat mesylate, blocked viral entry and reduce infection of human primary pneumocytes and lung cell lines by SARS-CoV-2. They also showed that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry (4). Another study performed by Bojkova et al (5) showed that camostat mesylate reduced cytopathogenic effect due to SARS-CoV-2 in human colonic cell lines. Camostat mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that is commonly used in Japan (at a dose of 600 mg/day) and has been successfully and safely used to treat pancreatitis-associated pain (6) and post-operative reflux oesophagitis (7). Side effects that have been reported are rare at these doses (nausea, diarrhea, hypersensitivity in 0.1 to 0.5% of the cases, cytopenias in less than 0.1% and hyperkaliemia and abnormal hepatic function in less than 0.05%).\nWe hypothesize that camostat mesylate, initiated early in SARS-CoV2 infection, can reduce viral infection and viral cytopathogenic effect by blocking SARS-CoV2 entry into cells, and therefore prevent deterioration toward severe forms of COVID19."

            "Current medical treatment of Crohn disease (CD) consists of immunosuppressive drug therapy (corticosteroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies). These agents control symptoms of CD in most patients but their withdrawal leads to disease relapse. They are also associated with serious side effects (infections, lymphoma, cancer, liver toxicity). Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies are the most efficient but are cost prohibitive. Moreover, each year, roughly 10% of responders to anti-TNF become refractory to treatment, most often because they become tolerized to these drugs. \nFuture CD drugs are small molecules or biologics that antagonize pro-inflammatory cytokines or gut homing of lymphocytes. Yet, they have similar safety issues as the immunosuppressive agents currently in use. \nThe current therapeutic algorithm for CD does not take into account the site of inflammation or composition of intestinal microbiota. Moreover, dysregulated intestinal immunity and overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines are not the only components of CD pathophysiology. Intestinal microbiota is abnormal and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CD. An E. coli specie with adhesive and invasive properties, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), has been described in ileal mucosa of patients with CD. AIEC has been found in 36% of patients with ileal CD and 6% of controls\nThe role of AIEC in CD has been thoroughly investigated in several laboratories around the world and has shown that AIEC is pro-inflammatory and could play an important role in intestinal inflammation associated with CD (1). As such, it may be an important therapeutic target. This randomized trial proposes a novel approach to the treatment of CD. It is individualized to patients colonized with AIEC who will be prescribed FDA-approved antibiotics that have been shown to be active against the bacteria in vitro. The treatment will be discontinued after 12 weeks. We hope to obtain clinical and endoscopic remission in patients who have been randomized into the experimental arm. If this trial is successful, it will be the first of its kind and will facilitate a new era of clinical research in patients with CD and concomitant infection with AIEC."

            "UVB, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing Adalimumab to Tocilizumab in sight threatening uveitis of BD. Anti-TNF has been used for BD uveitis for 15 years. The incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics. There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction therapy in severe BD uveitis. BD uveitis is considered as the most devastating inflammatory ocular disease. Risk of visual loss reaches 25% at 5 years and 80% of patients have a bilateral involvement. Contrasting with immunosuppressors or interferon-alpha, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma. However, anti-TNFα failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of severe sight threatening uveitis. There is little published information on use of biologics other than anti-TNF for severe BD uveitis. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. IL-6 expression correlates with BD activity and other immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with tocilizumab. Despite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in BD, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists."

            "BD uveitis is considered as the most devastating inflammatory ocular disease. Anti-TNF is a rapidly acting agent when compared to methylprednisolone or interferon alpha in suppressing ocular inflammation. However, they failed to demonstrate sustainable complete remission over 50 % of patients. Also, TNFa antagonists seems to have suspensive effect on ocular inflammation in BD. Tocilizumab has been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases and is one of the most promising biologics in BD. Rapid onset of action and steroid-sparing effect characterize the efficacy of tocilizumab. Nowadays, the management of severe BD still remains largely empirical. This is the first randomized, head to head, study for therapeutic management of severe uveitis in BD with biologics. This study may assess the benefit of tocilizumab comparatively to that of adalimumab in sight-threatening Behçet’s disease in terms of safety, efficacy and steroid sparing. It could thus improve the care of patients with BD and with uveitis in general. The expected benefit is both individual, in reducing morbidity and rate of blindness for young patients with BD, and collective, in reducing costs of hospitalization, and of dependence."

The posterior probability that the remission rate is at least 0.65 will be estimated in both arms, and the probability that the rate of remission in Arm B is above that in Arm A will be computed, with B indicating the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group.\n\nWe will use a Bayesian inference framework, where  denotes the probability of remission in the arm A. After inclusion of nA patient in Arm A and yA complete remission observed. Using a beta Be(,) prior for , the posterior probability of  is still a beta distribution given by Be(+,+) due to the natural conjugate property of the beta family for binomial sampling. \nIn our setting, the efficacy of the drug in arm A will be first assessed by comparison to some historical minimal value of interest, sometimes called the “minimum required treatment remission rate”. It has been set at 0.65 in this trial. Thus, we will compute \n\n\n\nSimilar analyses will be performed in arm B.\n\nHowever, in randomized phase II settings, the selection of a new drug is mostly based on evaluating the potential benefits of experimental treatments. Thus, one may consider dropping a new drug from further studies only if there is a rather low posterior probability that this drug is beneficial over the other by some targeted minimal level. This will be done by computing the  posterior probability of the difference in remission rates between the two experimental arms (Kawasaki in 2012) being greater than zero, with B being the tocilizumab group and A the adalimumab group:\n\n\n\nAs we consider a Bayesian design an interim analysis will be performed without any “alpha spending“ after inclusion of 30 patients. If  >0.80,  >0.80 and if  >0.80. The trial will be stopped.\nIf  <0.10 or  <0.10 the corresponding arm will be stopped and the following patients will be included in the other arm.\nIf  <0.10 and  <0.10, the trial will be stopped."

There is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best biologic agent in severe and refractory NIU. NIU can cause devastating visual loss and up to 20% of legal blindness. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of refractory/relapsing severe uveitis. The incidence of blindness in NIU has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of biologics, raising the question of whether these compounds should be used earlier in the treatment of severe non infectious uveitis. Contrasting with immunosuppressors, biotherapies act rapidly and are highly effective in steroid’s sparing thus preventing occurrence of cataract and/or glaucoma.\nDespite a strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in uveitis, which guarantees the innovative nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy already exists."

            "ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to that of cyclophophamide in severe manifestations of BD. Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size, involving young patients (from 12 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Therape\nutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations such as retinal vasculitis, cardio-vascular, or neurological involvement. Early recognition and vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological involvement. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However, the outcome of severe complications of BD is still poor. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendation (updated in 2016) for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide or anti-TNF plus glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel involvement) but recommendations on vascular disease and neurological involvement are based largely on expert opinion and uncontrolled evidence from open trials and observational studies. The need for further properly designed controlled clinical trials is apparent.. TNFa antagonists have been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases. In addition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent years with the use of anti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD manifestations. Physicians are still prescribing these compounds off-label use. We therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in severe and difficult to treat BD patients."

            "Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. In kidney transplant recipients (KTR) urinary tract infection (UTI) represent 45–72% of all infections, and 30% of all hospitalizations for sepsis. Acute transplant pyelonephritis are the most common complications occurring in more than 20% of patients, mainly in the first year after transplantation. They are associated with an increased risk of acute kidney rejection and long-term kidney graft dysfunction. Gram-negative bacteria, mainly E. coli, account for more than 70% of UTI in KTR. As those infections are favored by urinary tract modifications/defects and immunosuppression, they are often recurrent and necessitate repeated courses of antibiotics. Selective pressure due to antibiotic consumption, along with frequent hospital admissions and immunosuppression, are well known risk factors for the development of antibiotic resistant infections. Multidrug (MDR)- or extensively (XDR)- drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae including ESBL- or carbapenemase-producing organisms, are thus increasingly observed in transplant units and represent a global threat as very few new antibiotics are expected in the next decade. \n One main strategy to limit antimicrobial resistance is to reduce the duration of antibiotic treatment. A 7 day-course is recommended for simple acute pyelonephritis (APN) treated with fluoroquinolones or parenteral B-lactams, prolonged up to 10 or 14 days in the presence of underlying disease at risk of complications. Most KT teams treat patients between 14–21 days as recommended by American guidelines. However, the need to extend treatment duration in immunosuppressed patients is a poorly defined concept and the optimal duration of treatment for APN in KTR is not known as these patients are excluded from most studies.\n As there is an urgent need to reduce antibiotic consumption in this population at high risk of developing infections due to resistant pathogens, the hypothesis is that a 7 day-treatment is sufficient to cure APN with good clinical response after 48h of treatment in KTR and is as effective as 14 days."

Nevertheless numerous problems remain\nThese good results are obtained with intensive and prolonged treatments which include risk of toxic death, sequelae, and secondary malignancies.\nResults are still insufficient for high-risk forms, particularly those exhibiting an  early resistance to chemotherapy\nEarly bone marrow relapses (less than 30 months after diagnosis) still have a dismal prognosis which renders their prevention mandatory\nALL is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of biology and response to treatment. To envisage targeted treatments in the future renders key to decipher this heterogeneity. \nThe two cooperative groups FRALLE and the French centers of the EORTC-CLCG have decided to elaborate a common protocol for the treatment of childhood and adolescent ALL: Childhood and Adolescent ALL-France- 01(CAALL-F01).\n\nThe two previous studies from these groups have comparable results:\n\n\n2. A still major question in the field of ALL is the optimal use of L-asparaginase (ASNase)\nIt is known that administering ASNase results in the depletion of asparagine circulating in the blood, which starves the leukemic cells and results in their death. But indeed the use of ASNase varies between protocols considering the different brands, the dose and the administration modalities (rythm, route-IM or IV).\nThree major forms of ASNase are currently available: E. coli asparaginase (Kidrolase® in France), Erwinia asparaginase (Erwinase®, for patients with allergy) and a pegylated form of E.coli Asparaginase (Oncaspar® in USA and in Europe). \n\n2.1.Oncaspar®in the USA\nOncaspar® (PEGylated E. coli asparaginase or pegaspargase manufactured initially by ENZON and now SHIRE/Servier) was developed with the goal of reducing the immunogenicity of the native ASNase. In addition, Oncaspar®, because of its prolonged serum terminal half-life (t1/2), can be dosed less frequently than native ASNase with achievement of similar PD. \nIn the USA, CCG-1962 was the pivotal clinical trial supporting first-line use of Oncaspar®. Children with standard risk ALL (n=118) were randomized to receive native or PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (API from Merck) as part of induction and 2 delayed intensifications (DI) phases. Oncaspar® was administered intramuscularly (IM) at a dose of 2,500 IU/m2 once during the 4-week induction phase and once during each of two 8-week DI phases. Native E. coli asparaginase from Merck (Elspar®) was administered IM at a dose of 6,000 IU/m2 three times weekly for 9 doses during induction and for 6 doses during each DI phase. Children treated with Oncaspar® had a more rapid clearance of lymphoblasts from Day 7 and Day 14 bone marrow aspirates and a more prolonged asparaginase activity than those treated with the native form. In the first DI phase, 26% of native asparaginase patients had high-titer antibodies compared to 2% of those patients receiving Oncaspar©. High titer antibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not the Oncaspar® arm. The rate of infections, hospitalizations and the safety profile were similar between the arms (Avramis et al., 2002). Oncaspar® is approved for the treatment of ALL as a component of multi-agent chemotherapy in the USA since 1994, including for first-line use since 2006. This first line use has been transferred to a “new” Oncaspar® manufactured by Sigma-tau (pegaspargase; asparaginase from Lonza) in 2011, and now by SHIRE.\n\n2.2. Oncaspar® in Europe\nUntil now, Oncaspar®, currently available in Europe differed from the Oncaspar® marketed in the USA in terms of the asparaginase origin (Kyowa-Hakko v. Lonza), although both products are pegylated by Sigma-Tau in the USA. \nIn Germany and Poland, Oncaspar KH (Kyowa-Hakko) is registered as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy for reinduction in patients with a known hypersensitivity to native L-asparaginase (second-line). \nOncaspar KH has been used as the first line asparaginase preparation in at least three European ALL protocols: UK MRC protocols for ALL since 2003 (UK), BFM-AIEOP protocol for ALL since 2010 (Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland; Czech Republic, Israel), INTERFANT (a protocol dedicated to infants with ALL) since 2006 (many countries). \nSince January 2016, the European Commission has granted Marketing Authorization for use of ONCASPAR as a combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in pediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients. With this approval, Baxalta is authorized to market ONCASPAR in the 28 member countries of the European Union (EU), as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. This authorization is related to the Oncaspar incorporating the API manufactured by Lonza. This authorization has been transferred to the subsequent owners : Shire and currently Servier\n 2.3 Current status of asparaginase preparations in France\nUntil January 2016, only Kidrolase® was registered for first line use. \nErwinase® is available for patients that are allergic to native or pegylated asparaginase (MAA in France: 30.03.2015). Oncaspar ® (Oncaspar KH) was available only under a named patient program (ATUOn 19 November 2015) until Oncaspar ® received a marketing authorization on january 2016. 3. Different dosing and schedules using ONCASPAR® during induction therapy are currently proposed according to first-line ALL protocols opened at that date.\n- 2500 IU/m2 one infusion: COG and DFCI protocols (US) (using ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 3500 IU/m2 one infusion: St Jude protocol (US) (ONCASPAR LONZA)\n- 2500 IU/m2 two infusions: AIEOP-BFM protocol (Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 two infusions: EORTC protocol (Belgium) (ONCASPAR KH)\n- 2500 IU/ m2 one infusion: Interfant 06 protocol (mainly Europe)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1000 IU/m2 two infusions: UKALL protocol (UK)(ONCASPAR KH)\n- 1500 IU/m2 two infusions: DCOG protocol (NL)(ONCASPAR KH) \n4. The results of the 2003 Protocol UKALL are interesting: EFS 86% at 5 years, overall survival at 5 years 92% (Vora A et al, Lancet Oncol 2013 and 2014). They have been obtained by using a low dosage per infusion of Oncaspar KH (1000 IU/m2 IM) but repeated at 15 day intervals for induction.\nIn a subgroup of 482 patients treated in UKALL 2003, CYK Fong et al (ASH 2011) show that the dose that provides adequate asparaginase activity (> 100 IU/L) in 86% of samples studied after the 1st and second injection."

A cohort of children and adolescents with standard or medium risk ALL will be randomized to receive during induction either one infusion of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) 2500 IU/m2 at D12 or two infusions of ONCASPAR® (LONZA) at 1250 IU/m2 each at D12 and D26. Patients will then receive 2500 IU/m2 or 1250 IU/m2 per dose during consolidation and delayed intensification according to the initial arm of randomization. \nNon randomized question: In the High/Very High Risk groups, a non randomized intensification of the scheme of asparaginase administration is proposed during induction therapy: 2 infusions of 2500 IU/m2/day (D12 and D26) will be administered.

Chemotherapies give at best 30-60% of transient responses. While  interferon responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic KS represents an ideal model for evaluating new drugs since patients do not receive concomitant immunosuppressive regimens nor antiviral therapies.\nPembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently been shown to improve survival in several solid tumors. In KS few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples have been recently reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells in KS lesions.\nIn this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and endemic KS."

SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE, which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%, even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monocolonal antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side effects (progressive multifocal Leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies."

The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal clinical trials.

            "A quarter of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are performed in a situation of major ABO mismatch exposing patients to the risk of immunological pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after transplant.  PCRA after transplant is defined as anemia with low reticulocytes count (under 10 G/L) after day 60 despite good leucocytes and platelet engraftment, full donor chimerism, associated with the persistence of recipients hemagglutinins (anti-A or anti-B antibodies). Bone marrow evaluation when performed show erythroid hypoplasia. Red blood cells transfusions are necessary every two weeks until remission leading to impaired quality of life (anemia, repeated hospitalization), iron overload, and need for iron chelation therapy. Treatments currently used are inefficient (anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies, EPO, steroids, plasma exchanges, proteasome inhibitors) or at risk of severe acute GVHD (donor lymphocytes infusion). PRCA has been demonstrated to be associated with the persistence of recipient’s plasma cells.\nAnti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies which targets plasma cells secreting hemagglutinins responsible of PCRA are a promising treatment: 6 cases reported in the literature support a rapid and sustain efficacy (Chapuy, NEJM, 2018 Bathini, AmJHematol, 2019, Rautenberg, BMT, 2019 Salas et al.

This approach led to a global improvement in overall survival (5y-OS, 57%) whatever patient age but was responsible for an excess of treatment-related mortality in patients older than 45 years (5y-TRM in patients > 45y, 19%). Pediatric longitudinal studies pointed out that long term leukemia survivors have an increased risk of developing specific adverse events like dysmetabolic syndrome, obesity, decreased fertility, organ dysfunction, osseous events, or impaired cognitive functions.

            "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, severe and chronic systemic autoimmune disease (AD) characterized by vasculopathy, immune dysregulation and fibrosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction (primarily skin, lungs, heart gastrointestinal tract and kidneys), with high morbidity and mortality, altered health-related quality of life, all at high cost for patients and society. \nTreatment are mostly symptomatic and only autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) has shown long term improvement in overall and event-free survival with disease-modifying properties. However, AHSCT is contra-indicated in case of advanced visceral involvement and in eligible patients, it is still associated with risk of toxicity. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective treatments for severe SSc. \nMesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells which carry immunomodulatory, pro-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties, that can target SSc pathogenesis and its clinical manifestations. The increasing use of MSC, harvested from bone marrow (MSC(M)), adipose tissue (MSC(AT)), or umbilical cord (MSC(UC)) in a variety of indications, provides consistent evidence supporting their safety in humans. The efficacy of MSC(M) intravenous (IV) injection for treating acute graft versus host disease led to their marketing approval in 2012 and MSC(AT) (Alofisel) were approved for severe Crohn’s fistula in 2018.\nMSC represent a promising therapeutic approach for SSc. We have previously a) shown disease-specific abnormalities in MSC(M) from SSc patients, providing strong rationale to use allogeneic MSC to treat SSc patients, b) published the first phase I/II dose escalation trial using allogenic MSC(M) infusion in 20 severe SSc patients (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02213705, PHRC AOM 11-250) with no safety issues, significant improvement in skin fibrosis at 3 to 6 months after infusion which appeared lower thereafter, thereby supporting the need for repeated infusions.\nIn vitro, experimental and clinical studies suggest that MSC properties vary according to their tissue of origin/source. We demonstrated that compared to MSC(M), MSC(AT) are easier to harvest and display higher proliferative capability before entering senescence, higher genetic stability, and superior immunosuppressive properties. \nConsidering the above rationale, we hypothesize that use of healthy donors allogeneic MSC(AT) produced by Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS) will demonstrate a) no safety issues, b) an efficacy profile that will increase with repeated infusion of allogeneic MSC(AT) to treat SSc"

Each patient will be 1:1:1 randomized to one of two treatment arms (1 infusion of MSC (M0) or 2 infusions of MSC (M0, M3))or a placebo arm (total of 6 patients per arm, using randomization block of size 6).\nInclusions will be staggered, to allow the detection of SAE prior to inclusion of subsequent patients, according to the following waiting rules:\n- at least one week between two consecutive randomizations\n- interval of at least one month every three randomizations\n\nContinuous monitoring of the primary endpoint by the sponsor will be implemented to allow continuous Bayesian toxicity monitoring with a stopping rule implemented on the primary endpoint on cell infusions (see section 13 for details): \n- first analysis on the first 3 patients with completed M1 visits, \n- then analysis at any TRSAE at M1 or M4 visits\n- final analysis.\n \nThe stopping rule will be defined based on the estimated probability that the risk of treatment-related Severe Adverse Events (TRSAE) is >15%. “criterion 1” = the probability that the a posteriori probability of SAE is > 15%. The posterior probability of TRSAE (πtrsae) will be estimated using a Bayesian approach with a beta density. The stopping rule will be fulfilled if criterion 1 > 0.70 (meaning that we have a high probability that there is a greater than 15% risk of TRSAE). Interim analyses results will be presented to the DSMB for their recommendation.  In the case of early stopping, subsequent patients will not be randomized and all patients treated thus far will be followed up and results analyzed as described below. \nThere is no formal statistical test for sample size in a Bayesian framework. Nevertheless, one can invoke the frequentist framework to anticipate the expected precision in terms of safety. Indeed, after 18 infusions (6 patients with 1 infusion, 6 patients with 2 infusions), we will be able to estimate a risk of Severe Adverse Events (SAE) of 10% with a width of the exact 95% confidence interval equal to 32% considering independence between infusions."

            "Although the survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has dramatically improved over the last decades in the US and Europe, mortality remains high in adults. Moreover, many children and most adults develop a chronic debilitating condition due to organ damage. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the unique curative approach; it allows the cure of more than 95% of children transplanted from a matched related donor (MRD) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen(1),(2). To date, few studies have addressed the role of HSCT in SCD adults, due to the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and to the toxicity expected in older patients with a higher risk of organ damage. The development of safe, non-myeloablative conditioning regimens that allow stable mixed chimerism and avoid GVHD appears as an attractive option for HSCT to cure adults with severe SCD. Four groups have previously reported encouraging results in a total of 81 patients transplanted from matched related mobilized peripheral blood cells after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen (alemtuzumab and low dose of total body irradiation (TBI)) followed by post-transplant sirolimus. These studies demonstrate a high SCD free survival rate (no death related to transplant, 6 graft failures) and no GVHD. Ninety two percent of these patients were cured with normalized hemoglobin levels, resolution of hemolysis and stable hemoglobin A levels identical to the proportion observed in the donor(3–6). However, outcome comparison of patients transplanted with patients not transplanted are lacking. We design a prospective multicenter trial targeting patients over 15 years with severe SCD, and compare non-myeloablative transplant (when a matched related donor (MRD) is identified) versus no HSCT (for patients lacking MRD)."

            "Cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and requires therapeutic intervention. The management of noninfectious mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis is currently based on corticosteroids, and rituximab. During the last decade, several groups have reported on the efficacy of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. Rituximab infusions proved effective on main vasculitis signs, with a complete clinical response in 65-70% of patients. However, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis relapse is noted in up to 40% patients within few days to nineteen months after the last rituximab infusion. We and other have previously shown that serum BLys concentration was correlated with serum cryoglobulin level and with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia associated B non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In agreement with data in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren’s syndrome, we also observed decrease in BLys binding and in BR3 staining which was correlated with disease severity. Following rituximab serum BLys concentration significantly increased and may favour the survival of autoreactive B cell clones and relapses of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. A recent study has shown that rituximab does not reset defective early B cell tolerance checkpoints. An obvious solution to prevent the rise in BAFF levels from precipitating a flare of disease following rituximab therapy (and thus to achieve sustained remission of disease) would be to combine rituximab with BAFF blockade. In mice, a combination of B cell depletion and BAFF inhibition removes B cells in the marginal zone and follicular compartments more effectively than either treatment alone. A combination of B cell depletion and BAFF blockade was superior to B cell depletion alone with respect to reducing the numbers of plasmablasts and plasma cells, as well as reducing disease severity, in three different mouse models of lupus. In addition, promising results have been observed in patients with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis treated by rituximab plus belimumab and with good safety profile."

Randomized phase II trials are still poorly used, with still large use of single-arm phase II trial results that are interpreted relative to historical control subjects, introducing selection bias and confounding that may limit the validity of the conclusions. Thus, planning a phase II randomized trial appears a worthy investment considering finite patient and financial resources. This design is adapted to binary outcomes observed at the end of a fixed follow-up period and analyzed using an absolute difference in proportions that has been shown to greatly reduce sample size requirements. We thus used the approach for phase II randomized trials proposed by Simon R, Wittes RE, and Ellenberg SS that aims at controlling the probability of detecting a given difference in response rates. We hypothesize that up to 70% of the patients receiving placebo of belimumab and 85% of those treated by belimumab will achieve a complete remission of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis at week 25 (W25) and with steroid therapy stopped (0 mg/day) at W12."

            "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a lymphangioproliferation associated with human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) promoted by immunosuppression. HIV-related KS and iatrogenic posttransplantation KS are treated by immune restoration, in association with local or systemic therapies as chemotherapies if required. Conversely in classic and endemic KS, the underlying relative immunosuppression cannot be directly targeted. Treatment is poorly codified, mostly based on surgery or radiotherapy for localized KS. Most aggressive forms with visceral involvement are treated with chemotherapies or interferon, which give at best 30-60% of transient responses and may not be well tolerated in elderly patients. \nTalimogene laherparepvec is the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved by the FDA, in metastatic or unresectable melanoma with injectable nodal or cutaneous lesions. It is designed to induce tumor regression of injected lesions through direct lytic effects, and of uninjected lesions through induction of systemic antitumor immunity.\nIn Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), another virus-induced tumor, treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 axis inhibitors have proven efficacy, thus providing a proof of principle that immunotherapy could be effective in virus-induced tumors. Two cases of metastatic MCC succesfully treated with talimogene laherparepvec were recently reported, suggesting that talimogene laherparepvec may also be an effective therapeutic option. Considering the high immunogenicity of viral epitopes in KS tumors, the role of the immune evasion in the development of KS, and the cutaneous manifestations (>90% of patients) that can be easily injected, classic and endemic KS is a good tumor model to be targeted with talimogene laherparepvec."

            "An unrelated adult donor who is HLA-matched to the recipient at the allele-level (at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1) is considered the best choice in the absence of an HLA-matched sibling for patients needing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully HLA-MUD for the non-Caucasian population. Alternative donors (single HLA mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from haploidentical related donors) are still associated with higher non-relapse mortality and delayed immune reconstitution.\nA more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which targets alloreactive T cells generated early after an HLA-mismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and leaving unaffected the non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil. From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are  associated with similar overall and progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and thus potentially better results than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning regimen. \nA phase III randomized trial is currently addressing this question in France for elderly patients using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (HaploMUDelederly-01 /PHRC-K 14-045 / PI: D Blaise Institut Paoli Calmettes). A randomized prospective Phase III clinical trial comparing HLA 10/10 MUD and haplo-SCT after myeloablative conditioning regimen is urgently needed to answer to this question."

            "Scientific justification",
            "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a major therapeutic option for patients with acquired aplastic anemia (AA). Improved survival has been achieved in patients younger than 40 years old, thanks to better donor selection, conditioning regimens and graft versus host disease prophylaxis, together with improved supportive care. \nHowever, this has never been the case for patients over the age of 40 for whom the overall survival after HSCT never exceeded 60% at 5 years using available sibling or unrelated donor (Ref#3). Thus, the standard immunosuppressive therapy (IST) associating cisclosporine, horse anti-thymocyte globuline, together with the addition of eltrombopag (EPAG) is now considered as the standard of care in adult patients older than 40 years with AA (ref#1).\n\nIndeed, outcomes for patients who are refractory to first-line IST remain poor because of the lack of other non-transplant treatment and because of the poor results of transplantation at this age (Ref#2, 37). During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in this population after initial IST but risk of hemorrhage and long-term fatigue are still present. Moreover, clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis for MDS/AML (Ref#2). The overall survival of such adult patients with acquired AA refractory or in relapse after IST outside HSCT is thus about 60% at 2 years (ref #2).\n\nRecently, new strategies to prevent acute and chronic graft versus host disease, including T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have revolutionized the field.\nThese changes extended the option of HSCT primary for patients with refractory/relapse AA who lack an HLA matched donor (Ref#4). More recently the optimized Baltimore protocol using PTCy strategy also appears to improve engraftment and reduce graft versus host disease (GvHD) in other more classical setting (sibling and matched unrelated HSCT outside AA) (Ref#5).  One of the first cause of death after HSCT in patients older than 40 years of age with refractory/relapse AA is GvHD and the use of the optimized Baltimore protocol for all type of donors (haplo but also sibling and matched unrelated transplantation) within the field of AA rapidly appears promising (Ref#6&7). \n\nUsing an optimized HSCT procedure (marrow as source of stem cells and a PTCy strategy) not only in haplo-identical donor setting but also in case of an available matched sibling or unrelated donor might prevent drastically GvHD and eventually be practice changing. Evaluating this new transplant protocol as a new strategy is the main objective of “APARR”."

            "Scientific justification",
            "Outcomes for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are refractory to first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and who lack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor. Recently, the use of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in 40% of these patients (1). However, most refractory patients do not respond to ELT or other second-line treatment and are therefore exposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but clonal evolution including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis. Overall, the overall survival of such patients with acquired refractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years (2).\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative donor sources (i.e., mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood (CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be curative in patients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of complications than in transplantations from matched related or unrelated donors. Recently, our group showed that CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA (3). However, not all patients have available CB and CBT treatment related mortality is high in adult patients. Haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Preliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory SAA at Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA) seem promising (4, 5). We retrospectively analyzed data from 36 patients (median age 42 years) transplanted between 2010 and 2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation group. The 1-year overall survival was about 80% suggesting that this approach might be a valid option in this particular poor clinical situation (6)."

CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults but mortality using this approach is high for adult patients and CB is not always available. Haplo-SCT with PTCy recently showed promising results in this situation and nearly all patients have an available haplo donor (all biologic parents and children of a patient are haplo and each sibling has a 50% chance of being haplo). Moreover, haplo-SCT with PTCy is not only available for almost all patients but also a quick and cheap procedure. This study might thus demonstrate haplo-SCT with PTCy to be a curative option of adult patients with refractory aplastic anemia or children/young patients with no CBT available."
